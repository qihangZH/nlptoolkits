reader previously think issue chapter provide basic definition introduce concept will refer remainder book well reference work
also point reading familiar wealth scholarship practical guidance available subject taxation
tax may take criterion tax tax system evaluate
focus domestic tax system next chapter will consider question arise two domestic tax system interact ie international taxation
generally consider three category government function result need impose tax provision public goods distribution resource economic stabilization
term public goods refer goods service provide private market usually efficient
thing person need want society government leave job supply
example protection property right police force legal system utility power road street light
often thing person prepare pay directly government must supply free charge therefore need raise revenue fund cost provision
tax use raise fund provision public goods however also use distributive purpose
mean remove resource private sector direct accord perceive need eg social service even distribution wealth economy
tax system use direct redistribution mechanism collect person intend benefit particular concession rather collect give back form subsidy
often refer tax expenditure see para revenue forgone government order achieve particular economic social objective
final purpose tax impose economic stabilization
modern economy will fluctuation employment rate inflation rate currency exchange rate
government able use taxation mechanism control least influence fluctuation
important tax system flexible order allow government influence economy
one reason tax system often contain mixture different kind taxation rather rely one different form taxation influence economy different way responsive change
every tax three essential element base rate tax someone pay taxpayer
tax base subject tax thing tax
generally four main basis taxation consumption tax spend wealth tax income and profit tax earn poll head tax human
rate give tax extremely important evaluate impact
tax usually discuss term average marginal rate
average rate tax find divide total tax liability amount tax base
marginal rate tax rate taxpayer will pay additional unit base
proportional flat rate one average rate equal marginal rate mean extra unit base rate stay
example many country levy profit tax company single flat rate stay regardless level taxable profit
progressive rate hand average rate less marginal rate ie large base high rate
many country personal income tax progressive tax although worldwide trend recent year reduce degree progression step rate scale
conceivable common regressive rate scale average rate tax actually fall tax base increase value hence marginal rate always less average rate tax
tax actually truly regressive rate however sometimes flat rate tax consumption tax refer regressive income since proportion income pay out tax decrease level income increase
happen consumption tax levy income spend poor taxpayer might need spend whole income whilst wealthy taxpayer
finally tax must someone pay taxpayer discussion concept taxpayer usually lead distinction impact incidence taxation
legal taxpayer one name legislation responsible pay tax bear impact tax
economic taxpayer one actually end up part cash the end of the day bear incidence burden tax
use distinction tax broadly split two type direct indirect
broad generalization direct tax one legal taxpayer pass incidence tax mechanism build tax price charge person goods service
direct tax legal taxpayer must bear burden example departure tax impose person leave country income tax employee
indirect tax however incidence shift another person example consumption tax usually specifically design pay seller goods service pass on consumer
consider taxpayer one must also consider form taxpayer tax unit will take
will individual liable tax family unit share liability government define family
will government treat entity company trust partnership
evaluate tax tax systems
government decide mix tax use design reform tax system
number commonly accept criterion tax tax system evaluate although describe differently various book deal tax different country
purpose introduction tax generally two key criterion will discuss namely equity economic efficiency
criterion convenience simplicity flexibility beyond scope book focus international taxation although note country agree excessive complexity desirable feature tax tax system
context tax term equity equate fairness possible say good tax fair tax
regard perception fairness important important actual fairness generally accept taxpay population believe tax tax system fair likely comply rule attempt evade payment
term individual taxpayer common say fair equitable tax one levy accordance taxpayer ability pay economic resource available
horizontal equity dictate two person ability pay bear tax burden
vertical equity hand suggest one taxpayer great ability pay bear high tax burden principle use justify progressive tax rate increase tax base increase
measure ability pay however problematic raise question economic resource take account evaluate person ability pay
alternative mechanism ensure distribution tax burden equitable refer benefit principle suggest tax levy line relationship usage government service
problem approach however benefit attribute specific taxpayer difficult measure
principle economic efficiency also refer neutrality
principle state tax interfere decision making example decision whether work work spend save invest one product another
ideally tax neutral rational business and commercial decision make without influence tax consequence flow
practice however neutrality difficult achieve often government will want deliberately interfere person choice ensure certain behaviour encourage discourage
large body research examine notion optimal taxation entail design tax tax system minimize excess burden
concept excess burden refer economic distortion arise response tax actual monetary transfer private sector government
section consider briefly basic type tax explore different variation way construct administer
consumption base taxation involve consumer tax he or she spending goods service
number different form consumption tax
levy producer goods retailer
consumption tax design build in pricing structure pass on ultimate consumer goods service
good tax levy consumption especially luxury tax least feel person
seem measure voluntary since man may chuse sic far will use commodity tax
pay gradually insensibly naturally produce sobriety frugality judiciously impose confound natural price commodity scarcely perceive consumer
david hume tax taxation consumption historically old form taxation
indirect consumption tax levy ancient time still form significant portion tax revenue system
indirect tax purposely design pass on chain person handle goods service initial creation production final consumer
mean person legal liability tax therefore initially responsible payment bear incidence tax build price receive product thereby recoup purchaser
way tax pass on purchaser purchaser finally reach end consumer pass
end consumer bear incidence indirect consumption tax
base consumption tax levy may broad narrow
broad base consumption tax one impose wide range goods service exemption
government impose variety narrow base consumption tax various item consumption expenditure
common example include alcohol tobacco
usually tax impose revenue raise exercise although instance may attempt influence consumer spending pattern reason example discourage certain undesirable activity
tax sometimes impose irrespective whether also broad base consumption tax operation
broadly base narrowly base consumption tax need mutually exclusive
number question arise context rate structure
will single flat rate system multiple progressive rate
will rate apply goods service will category give low high rate basic rate use
many country category goods particularly export allocate zero rate
luxury often allocate high normal rate
advantage single rate tax broad base include great revenue raise potential simplicity neutrality towards consumer different type business reduce administrative cost government and compliance cost trader
consumption tax may single stage impose one point production consumption cycle impose
single stage tax advantage however problem arise example tax impose stage final consumption say manufacture level value add goods beyond stage retail level ignore
mean many service retail nature tax manufacture sale tax use
common form consumption tax recent year multiple stage tax usually model european style value add tax vat impose stage production distribution good service value add stage
administrative burden value add tax high single stage sale tax since great number taxpayer point collection may also less prone avoidance since collect increment stage process
vat first propose germany usa substitute company tax
advocate japan introduce france
real growth acceptance vat occur however formation european community follow adoption bydenmark germany netherlands luxembourg belgium ireland uk
recent version form consumption tax name goods service tax gst canada australia
retail sale tax impose point sale final consumer
retail sale tax theoretically raise revenue value add tax give rate pay one stage rather progressively life goods
therefore taxing point value add tax low compliance cost overall
arguably retail sale tax less robust absence check balance invoice credit system afford
wealth tax may comprise annual levy wealth tax transfer wealth death gift duty
wealth tax generally impose revenue raise capability rather purpose equity efficiency
term equity wealth tax justify basis effectively treat person equal capacity pay equally wealth must take account
ownership wealth give rise status prestige improve access credit security therefore take account assess taxable capacity
another argument imposition wealth tax double check administration income capital gain tax information provide regular wealth tax return
problematic aspect wealth tax usually associate valuation
whether wealth tax impose annually point realization asset example death valuation essential asset established market difficult obtain
land and property tax view form wealth tax usually impose annual basis respect value land question
land property fix geographical location transfer therefore provide stable readily identifiable tax base subordinate government
land and property tax favour source revenue local government authority reason
income tax levy taxpayer income
purpose income include variety thing like salary wages rental receive lease property proceeds business operation
income tax system usually provide variety deduction result subject tax net amount often refer taxable income
tax on personal income and business profit major revenue source industrialized nation also play grow role tax structure many develop nation
number design issue arise relation income tax lead considerable variation worldwide
example rate tax progressive maximum rate many interval
general trend lowering maximum rate certainly compare country impose high rate high income earner lead concern disincentive effect labour provision well tax avoidance evasion
interval point rate change smooth progression arguably lessen likelihood taxpayer behave aberrantly around threshold cost increase complexity
also question appropriate unit income tax eg individual married couple family
country choose levy income tax individual basis combine progressive tax rate scale face potential problem income splitting artificially transfer income family member reduce overall tax liability
design income tax system also require decision nature tax base
particular form income transaction activity exempt tax example encourage particular activity
item expenditure deductible determine tax base example private expenditure mortgage interest private residence
distinction income capital deal
many country last question address imposition separate capital gain tax recognize different nature capital receipt
capital gain define profit result increase value asset part owner stock trade inventory asset regularly sell
usually arise sale realization property tangible intangible usually distinguish income receipt
whether government choose include capital gain income tax base depend largely concerned comprehensiveness tax base
government opt separate capital gain tax uk
choose include capital gain within income tax system although often form concessional treatment either calculate amount gain apply rate tax gain uk australia
country hong kong korea singapore choose tax capital gain
lead substantial definition problem decide profit income nature therefore subject income tax capital nature therefore tax
jurisdiction usually extensive rule concern whether transaction nature trading rather capital transaction
factor motive frequency transaction length ownership source financing etc will often provide indication whether activity trading activity therefore appropriately tax income
one possible consequence tax capital gain increase likelihood circumvent distinction income capital receipt
two particular issue arise context tax capital gain
one point capital gain recognize tax purpose
system will realization although point view establish comprehensive income tax base arguably increase value asset recognize tax annually even without realization occur
realization usually adopt trigger point capital gain tax pragmatic purpose valuation problem arise discuss early context wealth tax
second problem inflationary gain
various mechanism adopt remove inflation component capital gain tax net include indexation mechanism use uk corporation simple approach use low rate tax income receipt recognition period time capital gain accrue
country company corporation separate legal entity
mean existence independent ultimate owner shareholder
company asset make profit incur liability right usually shareholder direct right asset profit
right shareholder company manage behalf director receive share profit periodically way dividend
treat company taxpayer separate shareholder allow government impose income tax directly
another alternative treat conduit profit flow shareholder
use view company shareholder relationship allow government levy tax shareholder company first instance
actual fact many country adopt combination two approach way compromise
commonly know classical separate system tax company company treat taxable entity separate shareholder
classical system company taxation operate corporate profit charge corporation tax country refer corporate income tax corporate level whether distribute shareholder hand shareholder profit distribute way dividend
view distribute profit may result number undesirable economic effect
end scale full integration system adopt view company mere conduit company income tax hand shareholder attribution basis
way company tax impose company first instance become merely prepayment individual income tax
company model view separate shareholder view company control shareholder separate taxable entity
proponent full integration model point ability pay relate natural person income good measure ability pay horizontal equity demand inclusive definition income
partial integration compromise approach separate conduit view company shareholder
usually consist allow relief dual level taxation respect distribute profit
partial integration may take number different form follow
dividend deduction
company allow deduct dividend distribution calculate taxable income

low rate tax apply distribute profit retain profit therefore reduce incentive company retain profit
dividend exemption
dividend exemption scheme company pay tax separate entity profit first instance
profit distribute shareholder dividend exempt hand shareholder recipient
dividend imputation
become common form relief double taxation company profit distribution
involve tax company first instance usually flat rate tax include shareholder taxable income amount dividend actually receive also company tax attributable dividend
process refer gross up
shareholder liability calculate credit rebate allow company tax dividend
way progressivity individual income tax rate scale maintain
common particularly international business context operation conduct company comprise group company common ownership
one question arise design system company tax whether treat company member group separate entity taxation purpose treat group one single taxpayer
country allow group consolidation total profit taxation purpose
usually form concession allow however transaction transfer loss group member
flat tax debate
idea behind flat tax progressive system income tax rate disincentive extra work savings reinvestment whereas tax impose low flat rate person would incentive work invest would benefit whole economy
argue tax revenue will increase steep rate tax rate low
point reach however government obtain maximum possible revenue give tax rate
point tax rate increase government get decrease amount revenue less incentive work hard invest incentive avoid pay tax
book hall rabushka call flat tax publish us new system flat tax propose
system wages salary would tax low flat rate personal allowance
business income would tax on
total revenue sale
input purchase business tax hand business
less wages pension pay worker tax hand employee
purchase plant equipment investment discourage tax system
model savings investment income tax
evidence flat tax work well far try either tax haven country hong kong jersey transitional economy estonia russia
develop country yet try flat tax despite obvious attraction
owens provide summary pro con flat tax conclude debate flat tax will dominate concern progressivity
tax expenditure
tax expenditure think negative revenue tax revenue deliberately foregone government order achieve particular purpose example encourage particular industry activity
respects tax expenditure think way public expenditure
variously describe tax break tax concession tax relief tax subsidy even tax aid
term first coin late stanley surrey us
practice tax expenditure define deviation tax norm benchmark result reduce tax liability specific group taxpayer specific type activity
difficulty arise however identify benchmark involve take view tax base rate structure tax unit necessarily involve judgment
development oecd describe three broad approach identify benchmark
conceptual approach use normal tax system base theoretical concept income consumption value add
reference law approach use country law define benchmark
expenditure subsidy approach categorize tax expenditure concession analogous subsidy
objective tax expenditure vary
introduce closely align tax burden ability pay
could include income tax allowance link marital status family circumstance exemption vat necessity
tax concession introduce change behaviour economic reason tax favour savings and investment vehicle relief pension contribution social reason relief health care education expense charitable donation
tax expenditure design create administrative efficiency example exemption financial service vat
tax expenditure may also take number different form example
exemption certain type income liability income tax
additional income tax deduction certain type expenditure research development
burton sadiq note tax expenditure significant virtue number distribution impact upon fiscal position state constitutional significance impact upon public administration general tax administration particular also relevance legitimacy democratic government
european commission workshop hold consider various aspect rationale business tax expenditure well tax expenditure report analyse various jurisdiction
reform tax expenditure appear offer prospects improve revenue raising distributional impact need carefully consider
use tax expenditure tax policy matter considerable debate disagreement role term tax competition international sphere

tax holiday usually subject condition respect geographical location type industry
important factor therefore location decision business
incentive discuss detail chapter
every tax entail compliance cost cost incur taxpayer meet requirement legislation
include cost engage tax adviser assist fulfil obligation legislation well suggest minimize tax liability legitimately otherwise
administrative cost cost government administer tax system
compliance cost bear taxpay population tend hidden administrative cost
also notoriously difficult quantify
study conduct various country however know compliance cost consistent vary considerably across different part taxpay population often onerous disproportionate small taxpayer large taxpayer example small business conduct sole trader compare multinational group company
type tax onerous term compliance administrative cost become important factor design tax system ie various tax will make up tax system particular form tax will take
publication pay tax produce jointly pwc world bank produce annually since provide interesting insight country regional difference way tax administer compliance burden impose taxpayer

base erosion refer reduction amount profit country tax
tax base country define person profit country permit tax

base erosion refer reduction number company amount profit country tax
company move residence different country cause profit arise different country eg transfer intellectual property ip another country royalty go ability original country collect corporation tax will diminish ie tax base reduce completely erode
payment make uk government grant tax deduction payment base erode payment
base erosion result either company part profit cease taxable country
addition tax planning strategy aim achieve double profit tax anywhere mne also engage planning activity aim attribute tax profit lower tax jurisdiction commonly although accurately refer profit shifting
important note talk profit company report external party ie accounting profit profit determine tax code form tax base particular country
sometimes low tax country will well recognize tax haven frequently country offer low tax regime alongside normal corporation tax system
achieve example special rule royalty income lightly tax

thus although paper legal term various subsidiary different country separate operational practice run single organization
oecd beps report describe unprecedented interconnectedness level

different tax system classify payment receipt differently give rise tax arbitrage discuss chapter
typically one country might classify payment subsidiary foreign hold company interest reduce taxable profit
however reach hold company country might classify dividend exempt tax
tax deduction match tax receipt
profit use pay interest tax anywhere double
difference recognition hybrid entity also exploit
beps report also voice concern mne take advantage tax treaty intend country involve
typically activity would involve use special purpose vehicle spv would tax resident one country therefore able take advantage double tax treaty obtain treaty benefit low rate exemption withhold tax

article also give general flavour nature tax residence individual
note nationality play minor role
note also reference number day tax year spend country yet will see number day physical presence country use several jurisdiction determine tax residence individual taxpayer
thuronyi identify three principal approach discuss
accord time spend particular country
country determine tax residence accord number day spend country give period consecutive period
country use calendar year use different period example uk use tax year run
country look
approach fairly objective case enable person tax residence determine quite easily
tax year use approach open taxpayer present nearly year spending just under six month country two consecutive tax year
reason time base system often contain average provision well
rule usually lay down statute law often use conjunction next approach
country land border culture employment eg person live one country work another might consider resident
mechanical nature time base test tend lead unsatisfactory result often use conjunction one approach determine residence
accord person connection particular country
approach consider tax residence personal attribute
usually enshrine case law impossible legislate regard every single person
fact relate person residence status consider together criterion regard definitive
netherlands make mention time limit determine residency status individual place high reliance however personal economic tie determine fact circumstance taxpayer
approach lend lay down statute law decision take base case law precedent tax authority interpretation accept practice
criterion use generally list article model tax convention
paragraph article model convention take approach particularly regard establish person centre vital interest
accord residence rule adopt civil law purpose
use approach country might determine anyone citizenship status perhaps right work consider tax resident
this may simple different rule different purpose although practice major economic power use type test us base residence test us citizenship
normal consequence tax residence fact tax residence establish country concern right tax individual worldwide income
whether country enforce right depend type double tax relief system employ see chapter
broadly country may operate credit system whereby credit give against tax liability residence country tax suffer elsewhere may operate exemption system sometimes refer territorial system whereby foreign income subject tax residence country
apply equally capital gain
country apply tax rate resident taxpayer although choose subject high rate deny benefit particular concession example zero rate band entitlement
often special rule will apply temporary resident limit tax base particular category employment income domestic source investment income
japan example resident intend live permanently japan stay more than five year treat temporary resident tax income foreign source income remit japan unlike resident tax worldwide income tax japanese source income
country reserve right tax income arise within border whether accrue use source principle
however uk example generally apply principle capital gain disposal uk property exception onwards gain uk residential property
thus earning income uk would pay uk tax income dispose chargeable capital asset uk residential property uk would pay uk capital gain tax sale
country tax consequence depend taxpayer domicile well place residence
concept domicile may use part process determine country taxpayer attach tax purpose
domicile concept specific taxation one determine country law individual bind
individual must always domicile may one domicile time
person domicile will country bear continue live
know domicile origin
possible person change domicile origin domicile choice attain age
age child domicile adult legally dependent domicile dependency
treatment split year residence also vary
country taxpayer treat resident the whole year certain condition meet timing arrival departure effect

however foreign national arrive uk first time may also deem ordinarily resident the day arrival intention remain uk number year
main practical effect difference ordinary residence adhesive concept

two main system use relieve double taxation credit system exemption system although many variation find system
credit system give credit foreign tax foreign income against home country tax liability income
exemption system mean home country tax income already tax abroad
consider good practice country adopt method double tax relief ensure capital export neutrality capital import neutrality
condition prevail working economy relatively unaffected issue double taxation resident gain advantage foreign income face tax burden resident
tax neutrality present tax decide factor decision whether trade abroad home
country decide give double tax relief effectively give up right tax full certain income resident
total amount taxable income gain country know tax base
choice system double taxation relief determine extent country able preserve tax base
although simple operate credit system use basic exemption system likely lead country resident transfer eg savings intellectual property ip tax haven
prevent many country combine exemption system foreign direct investment fdi credit system portfolio income know exemption participation
several variation credit system mainly affect extent pool foreign income related tax credit permit across different income source different time period
turnover tax vat normally cover double tax relief credit system
type tax often credit withhold tax foreign corporation tax
withhold tax tax payment income foreign country bear home country investor
foreign dividend sometimes attract amount double tax relief well relief foreign withholding tax
relief foreign corporation tax suffer company pay dividend profit dividend pay ie underlie tax may available corporate individual shareholder investment nature fdi
consider fdi oppose merely portfolio hold minimum shareholding normally per cent
many system double tax relief place today develop follow first world war many country begin levy first time increase rate tax
make problem double taxation pressing country time develop tax system independently emerge difference approach relieve international double taxation
central europe number treaty negotiate relieve international double taxation exemption mechanism ie country taxpayer resident attempt tax profit earn outside country
different approach however develop british empire us credit mechanism country taxpayer residence tax profit income wherever world earn give credit foreign tax pay
chapter will examine issue first consider closely nature double tax problem theoretical way relieve look closely two common method use exemption credit
increasingly country move towards territorial also know
us one country however choose retain credit system will look closely us system chapter
overview historical origin debate credit exemption see avery jones
whenever company individual undertake activity another country will deal one set tax rule therefore will potential international double taxation
term double taxation refer expose tax profit income
two type double taxation economic juridical
economic double taxation broad term cover situation amount income tax twice
example occur single country tax income twice case taxation corporate profit
subject corporation tax profit distribute shareholder form dividend shareholder subject income tax part full dividend receive
however form double taxation subject chapter
concerned international double taxation narrow legal form technically know juridical double taxation
juridical double taxation occur one country attempt tax income
arise specifically jurisdictional conflict rule use determine residence source
sometimes will occur different country use different rule attribution tax residence
instance one country may use place incorporation country use effective management control claim jurisdiction company
could also occur two country different rule determine source income
commonly however juridical double taxation occur company individual source income country country residence
home country often tax income use residence principle foreign country tax income use source principle
jones ltd company resident country ponstantia subsidiary pire ltd country ruritania
ponstantia tax system will charge worldwide income jones ltd tax use residence principle
thus dividend receive jones ltd pire ltd will fully subject ponstantian tax
ruritania normally charge tax income source within jurisdiction
jones ltd will therefore liability ruritanian tax dividend pay pire ltd reason source principle
share pire ltd consider source ruritanian income dividend ruritanian company belong ruritania jones ltd
thus profit use pay dividend will suffer tax twice ponstantian tax residence basis ruritanian tax source basis
term normally apply country residence act prevent reduce extent resident tax income
many different system double tax relief
mechanism relief double taxation often set out double tax treaty dtt
bilateral less commonly multilateral agreement pair country two country set out will eliminate double taxation resident respect income gain derive country
govern international law consider detail chapter
addition use double tax treaty country normally set out provision unilaterally relieve double taxation resident domestic law
ensure relief double taxation available cover income receive country double tax treaty
three main method country may give relief double taxation
exemption method method country residence tax foreign income tax resident
foreign income say exempt
credit method income earn overseas country tax country residence
foreign tax pay credit against tax income charge country residence
thus country residence give credit foreign tax suffer
deduction method deduction method foreign tax treat expense business
country residence tax foreign income allow deduction foreign income foreign tax pay
consider follow example compare three method
example
company resident country rate corporation tax per cent branch country
country branch pay country profit tax profit rate per cent
follow table demonstrate different method alleviate double taxation impact effective tax rate
note credit foreign tax normally exceed amount tax income charge country residence explain following section
relief double taxation company must pay full tax country country make investment country expensive compare business country
company earn income country maximum tax rate would per cent
deduction method provide relief double taxation reduce effective tax rate per cent
method use number country early part the twentieth century tax rate quite low
the century progress however rate tax increase deduction method decline popularity alternative exemption credit method provide great relief double taxation
deduction method fully relieve double taxation favour domestic investment indeed base notion national neutrality discuss chapter
country still use conjunction method optional system uk benefit perhaps taxpayer accumulate loss benefit system
country use either exemption credit method recommend oecd
rest chapter will focus two method
example rate tax country foreign host country high country residence home country situation total tax pay exemption method use credit method
foreign tax rate high credit and exemption method produce net tax liability
effectively tax foreign income country residence either method
happen foreign tax rate low taxpayer country residence
example
company resident country rate corporation tax per cent branch country
country branch pay country profit tax profit rate per cent
exemption credit method compare situation
possible say foreign tax rate low domestic tax rate exemption method will give great relief
this may good taxpayer point view government country taxpayer residence case country
example exemption method mean country collect tax foreign profit
credit method limitation amount credit
example foreign tax rate low domestic rate credit method allow country still collect tax rate per cent
however example foreign tax rate high domestic rate credit method result country give tax credit foreign tax suffer
country give credit would subsidize investment country protect taxpayer per cent rate tax country
would refer full credit country taxpayer residence allow credit foreign tax pay taxpayer
since reduce tax take home country foreign tax rate high domestic rate oecd recommend ordinary credit
method country use credit method will adopt place limit amount foreign tax credit
limit amount tax would pay profit earn home instead overseas
use full assume company also profit earn home country credit method calculation example would look like exemption progression
country apply single rate corporation tax whilst use rate band bracket system similar uk income tax rate band system
rate band system progressive system company profit allocate several rate band corporation tax purpose
country two rate tax company profit per cent profit per cent limit
assume amount branch profit taxable country would sufficient move company one tax bracket next
let assume company country profit exactly foreign branch profit
word without branch profit would tax per cent branch profit profit would tax per cent remain profit would tax per cent
mean amount tax foregone even ie even costly government overcome oecd recommend variation exemption method refer exemption progression
effectively foreign profit treat exempt however still take account decide rate domestic tax will apply rest taxpayer profit use up part low rate band
country tax income tax country
country tax forgone country income simply exempt progression country income tax total country tax country tax foregone apply exemption progression choose method double tax relief
choose method combination method employ country will need consider follow factor
capital export neutrality
protection tax base
cost state taxpayer method adopt
capital export neutrality
capital export neutrality main reason country try prevent double taxation business profit
concept neutrality concern whether tax distortionary
see chapter argue good tax one influence taxpayer commercial decision
chapter note capital export neutrality will exist incentive disincentive resident investor invest home rather abroad
achieve company total worldwide tax liability whether pay tax solely home government home foreign government
next two example demonstrate difference full credit ordinary credit
baldevian company consider expand set up new factory either country baldevia country morania
baldevia effective corporation tax rate per cent
morania effective corporation tax rate per cent
capital export neutrality desirable permit expansion country business overseas market without tax penalty thus encourage export bolster country foreign earnings contribute towards health country economy
perfect capital export neutrality would achieve every country tax system tax return matter world company tax
capital export neutrality difficult achieve foreign tax rate generally high domestic tax rate
achieve country residence prepare operate system full credit
application credit method use far example ordinary credit
example rework example use system full credit whereby credit foreign tax give against residence country tax foreign income also against residence country tax domestic income
thus tax liability income earn baldevia
credit method broadly capital export neutral taxpayer state residence tax initially state normal tax rate
however note may still important difference tax position export firm firm operating exclusively home country
overall global tax liability export firm may high due adoption ordinary restrict double tax relief foreign tax excess domestic tax
timing tax payment will differ foreign dividend will generally tax receive residence country rather profit use pay dividend earn
note chapter corollary capital export neutrality indifferent whether buy import home grow product
home country tax rate high foreign tax rate import will cheap domestically produce item
capital import neutrality require firm operate particular country suffer worldwide tax profit arise country whether resident country whether resident elsewhere
consider capital import neutrality attain country major trading partner essentially tax system rate
protect domestic tax base
chapter define tax base individual company resident country type income profit earn country
two main method deal double tax problem good protect tax base
exemption method eliminate foreign income possibly capital gain well resident individual corporation tax base altogether
principal danger exemption method country tax base resident will move mobile capital country
thus tax incentive deposit cash foreign bank account invest foreign rather domestic company interest and dividend payment capital gain sale share exempt country tax residence
naturally foreign country will one rate tax low country tax residence
thus exemption method simple form say encourage legal use tax haven
ignore condition may attach exemption will examine later chapter
credit method tax foreign income keep within tax base
however country tax generally low country resident derive income gain credit method will still result tax revenue home country foreign income gain resident
credit method encourage use tax haven tax pay abroad low domestic tax foreign income home country tax pay
credit method therefore afford protection domestic tax base exemption method
one difference two method relate complexity
simple form exemption method easy operate present administrative cost country residence
taxpayer account one tax authority tax foreign income
however problem flight mobile capital low tax country many country operate variant basic exemption method
common variant apply foreign dividend income exemption activity clause allow exemption method operate respect dividend income foreign direct investment taxpayer may say participate management foreign company dividend receive
income gain foreign portfolio investment subject separate system double tax relief credit
run dual system double tax relief introduce complexity system will recall chapter generally think undesirable
tax authority administer two system double tax relief
foreign income gain must characterize either foreign direct investment portfolio investment determine method double tax relief appropriate
inevitably lead lengthy expensive dispute
make investment decision taxpayer may uncertain method will operate respect particular source income lead need advance ruling tax authority
another variant often adopt exemption progression already note this may use country progressive tax rate structure
although foreign income exempt domestic tax take account work rate tax domestic income
foreign income allocate against low band income domestic income become taxable high rate
exemption system often incorporate activity clause sometimes refer exemption participation progression
credit method inherently complex simple version exemption system require computation tax foreign income country residence
foreign tax must examine determine qualify double tax relief foreign tax credit ie whether creditable
often considerable difficulty establish amount foreign tax credit
credit consist foreign tax pay foreign income
sufficient simply apply headline rate foreign tax gross foreign income
requirement mean foreign tax liability must know certainty home country will grant double tax relief
delay establish amount overseas tax pay result delay finalize tax position country residence
practice tax authority may allow degree relief provisional basis tend discretion
foreign dividend particular present problem determine amount foreign tax credit
legal system dividend may pay company accumulate distributable profit
profit accumulate several year will subject tax different rate
therefore necessary credit method double tax relief rule establish exact source ie company profit use pay dividend term country earn period earn
consider type foreign tax country may consider acceptable purpose reduce domestic tax liability resident
sometimes know creditable tax
two type tax may credit connection foreign dividend
direct tax foreign shareholder withholding tax
indirect tax income suffer foreign usually foreign corporation tax
country use credit system will publish list creditable tax
generally speak country give double tax relief turnover tax sale tax indirect tax
often relief necessary gatt general agreement on tariffs trade permit indirect tax export rebate ascertain accuracy
instance export eu country country carry vat
unfortunately definition sale tax differ country country
thus characterization foreign tax crucial determine whether double tax relief will available home country
dispute often refer treaty characterization problem
large body tax law issue
double tax relief will usually available capital tax foreign capital gain tax inheritance tax
represent tax liability due source principle commonly levy
also frequently levy resident mechanism ensure tax compliance
although country legally permit levy taxation source principle practical difficulty collect tax directly foreign person
instance ruritanian company uk resident shareholder will practical ruritanian government insist uk shareholder file ruritanian tax return make payment tax due dividend ruritanian company
uk shareholder fail comply little ruritanian government cost effective manner enforce tax liability
therefore ruritanian tax due source principle will probably deduct total dividend payment pay over ruritanian government ruritanian company uk shareholder receive dividend net ruritanian source taxation
know withholding tax source taxation withhold total payment
ruritanian company jurisdiction ruritanian government withholding requirement legally enforceable
typically withholding tax settle liability uk shareholder ruritanian tax law without need submit ruritanian tax return
normally levy fairly low rate maximum usually basic rate income tax
double tax treaty usually state country involve ruritania uk may tax dividend ruritania
ruritania take slice tax via withholding tax uk charge normal rate give relief credit method ruritanian withholding tax
jones ltd ponstantian resident company hold share company resident ruritania
jurum inc declare dividend per share
jones ltd due dividend
ruritania levy withholding tax dividend pay shareholder
country may grant double tax relief foreign corporation tax against domestic tax liability resident shareholder dividend foreign company circumstance resident shareholder hold significant percentage share foreign company
recognize fact dividend represent profit subject foreign corporation tax
important distinction make international taxation may term portfolio investment foreign direct investment
portfolio investment term use shareholder small percentage total share company
holding may part portfolio similar small shareholding
private individual will typically hold share manner spread total investment across many company reduce risk loss one company perform badly
foreign direct investment term use significant shareholding foreign company typically per cent
circumstance shareholder able exercise degree control influence affair company run risk significant financial loss company perform badly
foreign direct investment oppose portfolio investment country will allow foreign corporation tax suffer foreign profit dividend pay set against home country tax liability addition withholding tax
word shareholder claim double tax credit foreign corporation tax pay company pay dividend
foreign corporation tax sometimes refer underlie tax
assume fact example except jones ltd share
effective rate corporation tax ruritania assume per cent
company branch foreign country profit branch will usually tax foreign country source principle accruals basis
usually foreign country will charge branch profit corporation tax
country also levy withholding tax profit repatriate head office country
know branch profit tax use source country collect corporation tax and withholding tax regardless whether foreign investor choose invest via subsidiary via branch
chapter expand issue raise chapter consider double tax relief system work operational practice
chapter
double tax relief practice basics
chapter contain broad outline main issue choice system double tax relief
discuss two main form double tax relief credit exemption method basic level acknowledge deduction method alternative less used method
actual practice double tax relief complicated several reason
nearly country adopt hybrid system double tax relief
commonly encounter type system use exemption method income foreign direct investment fdi eg branch profit dividend trading subsidiary
however exemption method expose residence country excessive loss revenue many country employ credit method income class passive income eg interest certain royalty dividend minority holding
country operate version exemption credit detailed rule
country use credit method manner incorporate many variation way foreign tax credit use extent use
credit method use grant double tax relief foreign dividend receive resident corporation rule tend particularly complex
country operate progressive tax rate structure often allocate exempt foreign income low tax rate band exemption briefly outline chapter
country will normally insist method use domestic law also use dtt enter into
however sometimes difference exist either part treaty negotiation process subsequent enter treaty country change method double tax relief use domestic law
instance many uk treaty specify credit method income whereas practice exemption method would apply foreign dividend receive uk corporate taxpayer
even system advertise use credit method may practice result close exemption method
foreign income tax repatriate eg dividend subsidiary pay resident parent company indefinite deferral income mean effectively exempt
particular problem face us credit system
chapter contain good deal material uk tax system uk system double tax relief company subject considerable ongoing revision the past decade make excellent case study alternative system double tax relief
uk introduce exemption method foreign dividend uk company order improve competitiveness uk location hold company ensure compliance
although exemption apply foreign dividend regardless whether foreign shareholding represent foreign direct investment fdi portfolio investment complex govern area
uk also introduce option double tax relief exemption method profit foreign branch
use
country submit report international fiscal association seeblanluet durand country report system base mainly credit method whilst report mainly use exemption method
remain country report hybrid approach
report generally put forward view credit method less likely facilitate tax avoidance
however administrative burden therefore cost significant compare exemption method yet credit method think unlikely yield high tax revenue
considerable ongoing discussion us whether system double tax relief exemption foreign dividend adopt

historically uk operate series complex version credit method corporation tax purpose since use two important class foreign income earn uk corporation ie foreign dividend branch profit
foreign income uk company type uk taxpayer still grant double tax relief credit method
variation credit method
credit method practice much complicated depict chapter
country use credit method particular rule within domestic law
foreign tax credit calculate
whether limit amount foreign tax credit relation amount domestic taxation
whether credit give merely foreign withholding tax whether extend relief foreign corporation tax profit use pay dividend
whether tax credit low tier company recognize instance company country company country turn company country tax payable country double tax relief claimable tax credit arise tax pay country set against tax liability country
whether unused foreign tax credit use previous future tax year whether use company corporate group recipient
whether tax credit may set against domestic tax liability foreign income give rise foreign tax credit
know pool two main type
onshore pool high foreign tax credit source overseas income offset against residual home country taxation foreign source income
favourable system ordinary normal credit taxpayer
system offshore pool multinational group may route dividend overseas subsidiary intermediate hold company pay single dividend ultimate parent company
parent country tax authority permit onshore pool strategy achieve pool offshore
lack facility onshore pool circumvent parent company one immediate source foreign income dividend offshore intermediate hold company
provide tax authority parent company country recognize tax credit attach dividend subsidiary shareholding chain dividend intermediate hold company pay carry tax credit represent average rate tax suffer dividend pay low tier company intermediate hold company
note avoid additional tax liability intermediate hold company would locate country netherlands operate double tax system exemption participation
foreign tax may credit
consider exemption system detail first consider example credit system operation
us one country continue use credit system double tax relief
us may credit against us income tax qualified foreign tax pay accrue foreign country
taxpayer may choose each year take credit against us tax deduction against us taxable income foreign income tax
foreign tax credit compute separately two different category income
know separate basket system
passive income basket interest certain dividend rent item investment income
general basket everything else include dividend company us corporate shareholder per cent capital
dividend control foreign company us person collectively per cent vote value pay company us person least per cent may also fall general basket
decide basket fall rule use
broadly dividend pay control foreign company trading income dividend treat active rather passive income
treatment would also apply interest rent royalty receive provide pay us recipient trading income
per cent ownership rule meet us shareholder least per cent foreign company still apply dividend possibly royalty certain condition meet
overhead expense us parent company interest administrative expenditure relate income category deduct foreign income computation us tax attributable category income
within category foreign income passive active foreign tax credit permit
mean excess foreign tax credit one source foreign active income offset against residual us tax liability another source foreign active income ie foreign tax credit less us tax
effectively permit averaging foreign tax rate within two basket
rationale separate out income way easy us firm position asset give rise investment income low tax country passive investment asset tend financial asset therefore mobile
hand income foreign direct investment dividend manufacture subsidiary branch likely position country good suited investment reference general commercial factor
therefore likely suffer substantial amount foreign tax
without separate basket total foreign income total foreign tax credit would amalgamated effectively high tax credit foreign direct investment income would offset low foreign tax credit foreign passive investment income
however passive investment income suffer high rate foreign tax us company effective rate per cent foreign income transfer across general basket know high tax kickout
credit category less amount foreign tax pay accrue respect category us tax foreign income category
follow formula use determine credit
total taxable income within separate category source us income tax
taxpayer aggregate net income net loss within category source outside us calculate category separate foreign tax credit limitation
us corporation deem pay may claim credit portion foreign tax pay accrue foreign corporation hold least voting stock first tier corporation
credit underlie tax
domestic corporation also deem pay portion tax pay accrue foreign second sixth tier corporation certain case
foreign tax pay accrue exceed amount may credit tax year excess carry back one year forward ten year
foreign levy ie payment require person foreign country qualify creditable foreign tax ie one double tax relief will give tax predominant character income tax us sense
live issue us fact us base multinational group will go great length avoid repatriation foreign income
rather foreign subsidiary pay dividend us profit allow accumulate recirculate outside us
reason give usually us corporate tax rate per cent high levy country repatriate profit us via dividend would result additional tax payable multinational group
will see chapter big multinational apple corporation avoid repatriation profit us
however reason lack repatriation foreign profit may complex discuss next paragraph
much discussion whether us ought move exemption method active income consensus appear rather reduce us tax bill us company foreign income change would actually increase us tax payable
overview possibility us international tax reform seekadet
intuitively one might think us retain credit method would collect less tax switch exemption method
however study grubert altshuler estimate total us tax revenue would increase us adopt exemption method foreign dividend income
foreign dividend holding ie excess per cent share pay company hold treat active income
dividend often carry withhold tax credit also credit foreign corporation tax suffer foreign profit dividend pay
mean foreign dividend often carry tax credit excess per cent us domestic rate
excess foreign tax credit set against foreign income active income basket royalty little us tax pay receipt foreign royalty either
dividend exempt highly likely would us tax pay foreign royalty receipt would carry foreign tax credit foreign withholding tax probably rate per cent
us government try many strategy collect tax foreign earnings us base multinational
potential residual us tax revenue stake fact us would like inflow fund reinvest least partially us estimate fund hold outside us us base multinational
the past offer repatriation holiday involve allow us shareholder company take dividend foreign subsidiary subject low usual rate us tax limited period
meet limited success
possibly one important reason lack repatriation foreign earnings fact repatriate even little us tax cost future earnings generate reinvestment foreign earnings would likely subject us tax per cent rate
repatriation holiday give us corporate shareholder tax deduction equal per cent increase foreign earn repatriation effective tax rate per cent proportional allowance foreign tax credit
however despite measure try ensure money invest wealth create activity merely pay parent company dividend prove impossible impose restriction use andgravelle report study find repatriate fund use share repurchase equivalent dividend payment acquisition firm debt reduction
none use represent increase investment economic stimulus thus object repatriation holiday meet
case repatriation holiday result reduce tax revenue us government although might increase the early day least foreign earnings overseas subsidiary repatriate holiday would repatriate anyway normal tax rate
proposal another repatriation holiday shelve partly projection although would produce tax revenue the first three year of operation would go lose us government the next eight year gravelle
tax amnesty repatriation holiday also effect deter us taxpayer repatriate foreign earnings outside repatriation holiday anticipation another one will along soon
obama budget proposal
president obama propose per cent minimum tax foreign earnings ongoing basis
even controversially budget propose deem repatriation accumulate earnings foreign affiliate us corporate shareholder
proposal go hand hand plan switch credit method exemption method foreign dividend
much estimate unrepatriated asset believe cash firm study credit suisse report company account indicate relevant asset cash
would unpalatable impose tax unrepatriated asset cash asset might well consist productive asset plant machinery would never practice liquidate provide repatriatable cash chance deem repatriation become law appear slim
gravelle advance number argument concern effect tax credit repatriation would make anyway conclude deem repatriation would unlikely result net revenue gain
exemption us
real problem face us lose out tax revenue foreign earnings indeed case double tax credit give little us tax liability remain foreign earnings reinvest us thus contribute wealth us economy
us government want foreign earnings remit reinvest us even effectively tax
credit method hamper aim us base multinational want pay even small percentage residual us tax foreign tax credit apply
increase global tax liability need
move exemption system active income include dividend shareholding would remove disincentive repatriate
however move would appear sanction practice us base multinational the past
thus various plan move exemption system first impose deem repatriation accumulate foreign earnings put forward us the last decade
none gain traction legislature
seem proponent various plan produce wildly differ estimate cost benefit
additionally change exist us tax code political recent government administration position wield sufficient political support across houses us corporate tax reform despite appear general consensus within us political corridor reform need
main difficulty though none address root cause reluctance us base multinational pay us tax worldwide profit per cent rate corporation tax
context recent proposal shift destination cash flow tax system fleming et al ask question congress profit us multinational corporation earn primarily low tax foreign country accumulate offshore yet bear us tax

author explore option transition solution recommend treat foreign earn accumulation tax shareholder control foreign corporation cfc rule effectively
current us administration president trump recently publish brief plan historic tax reform include plan significantly reduce us corporate tax rate introduce trillion dollar overseas territorial tax system
detail plan yet reveal significant tax reform will challenge politically
foreign tax may credit against chinese tax particular source income foreign tax suffer country income arise necessarily exactly source within country

company would able claim double tax relief treaty
note chapter practically unheard country operate pure exemption system
system would feasible absolutely tax incentive move income capital produce asset country low tax jurisdiction
two main variation exemption progression exemption participation
many system incorporate element
sometimes refer exemption activity clause
example orville ltd follow foreign income
example distinction must make income regard active income therefore exempt income regard passive income therefore subject credit method
problem passive income one taxpayer may active income another
many company interest cayman islands bank account would passive income
international bank may well consider trading active income
royalty income probably passive income
dividend wright inc might either passive active income depend activity
manufacturing company investment income dividend would consider active income
however wright inc income portfolio dividend passive income dividend pay wright inc would probably also consider passive income
whether dividend emerald inc consider passive active would depend emerald inc income might minimum shareholding impose tax authority orville country orville ltd need attain dividend could consider active income
typically exemption system set bar per cent shareholding
finally profit us factory would almost certainly regard active income therefore exempt
must conclude exemption system pure exemption system go susceptible income characterization dispute
exemption
jangles inc tax resident inistania operate double tax system exemption progression
corporation tax rate inistania thus ruritanian dividend tax use up per cent rate band push inistanian income per cent bracket

one solution would say foreign branch profit exempt foreign branch loss may set against uk taxable profit
would unpopular uk company ability offset foreign branch loss against uk profit the early year foreign branch operation may make difference foreign branch viable business proposition
system granting double tax relief exemption profit foreign branch uk company therefore follow
uk company must make election wish foreign branch profit exempt
election make double tax relief branch profit continue grant use credit method

double tax treaty dtt instrument international law govern vienna convention law of treaties whilst text usually base model tax convention mtc provide oecd
provision treaty normally override conflicting provision state domestic law
double tax treaty usually bilateral two taxing state contract states
context dtt therefore refer state rather country
two state tax system
will example different definition constitute tax residence different interpretation source principle may adopt different system give double tax relief
one state might tax amount income accord source principle another state might tax amount income accord residence principle
thus taxpayer operating two state rely solely domestic tax law two state may well find subject double taxation
enter dtt two state aim minimize extent taxpayer will subject double taxation
double tax treaty provide consistent common logical basis pair state divide up taxing right person tax connection state whether reason tax residence existence source income
improve taxpayer position would result application state domestic law never increase taxpayer liability
chief purpose dtt
provide means settle upon uniform basis common problem arise field international juridical taxation per oecd introduction model tax convention hereafter oecd mtc
prevent evasion tax make provision exchange information tax authority assistance collection tax debt owe treaty partner
protect taxpayer against double taxation direct indirect great extent protection offer domestic law
prevent tax discourage free flow international trade investment transfer technology
prevent discrimination taxpayer
provide measure fiscal legal certainty international operation
individual enterprise consider invest foreign state obtain indication way investment financial manufacturing sale otherwise will subject tax state
tax treaty main bilateral agreement pair state refer contract states will decide tax system will interact ensure resident state get double tax relief entitle
without tax treaty difference two tax system involve even difference interpretation tax term within system could mean state entitle tax income
instance state might state consider every person state passport tax resident
state might different rule say every person spend more than six month of the year state tax resident
hence person possess state passport spend more than six month of the year state would find consider tax resident thus possibly taxable worldwide income state
tax treaty therefore contain clause whereby two state agree will interpret tax residence limit circumstance person find dually resident hence fully liable tax state
besides key function provide relief double taxation tax treaty will provision aim prevent tax avoidance
take form specific rule say prevent income partnership end up taxable anywhere generally will usually provision exchange tax information contracting state
one extremely important function tax treaty provide mechanism whereby two state interact relatively informal way double tax dispute problem situation deal directly tax authority two state rather go normal diplomatic channel
dtt provide mutual agreement procedure two tax authority
oecd mtc award priority tax right state source
state residence usually agree either give credit tax pay state source operate exemption tax
benefit use oecd mtc provide common rule interpretation via extensive commentary aid negotiation new treaty provide measure certainty multinational enterprise plan tax affair
also provide useful means reduce tax evasion avoidance means exchange information clause
definition source taxable deal length oecd commentary mtc
another major subject deal mtc control transfer price related enterprise
article commonly consult probably give maximum possible withholding tax rate dividend interest royalty although must always remember withholding tax charge domestic law low rate charge rate give ddt will practice apply
article often give rise legal dispute whereby contract states agree treat taxpayer without discrimination
several model dtt besides oecd mtc
un model commonly use dtt least one party develop state award great taxing right source state
us use model
model treaty largely base oecd mtc
interpretation dtt need approach purposive manner may correct approach interpretation state domestic law
broad interpretation word use treaty appropriate rather narrow meaning adopt interpretation word use domestic law
vienna convention lay down ground rule treaty interpretation generally
treaty assume enter good faith understanding state will keep promise make dtt
oecd commentary acceptable aid interpretation
state renege treaty instance newly elect government assert previous incumbent authority competent enter treaty
incumbent head state minister regard fully competent enter treaty behalf state
oecd mtc will significantly update follow oecd beps project time writing change agree upon part beps project yet incorporate official version model
facilitate speedy action implementation beps recommendation new multilateral instrument mli devise effect automatically update bilateral treaty enter signatory
mli discuss detail para
treaty govern international law rather domestic law usually vienna convention law oftreaties
convention lay down rule matter territorial scope treaty general rule interpretation breach treaty deal fundamental change circumstance one state
general rule provision contain within treaty override domestic tax law
domestic law overrule treaty provision know treaty override controversial area
may intentional take form newly enact domestic law frown upon unintentional domestic court decision fail use treaty definition depart way vienna convention rule interpretation treaty
this may mistake ignorance deliberate much tax revenue stake
note state specifically provide subsequent change domestic law will contradict treaty override treaty
sometimes refer lex posterior rule
follow us clear intent override treaty express statute concern
clearly unsatisfactory point view state treaty partner
central tenet vienna convention treaty conclude good faith presumption state will want override treaty
easily treaty provision override domestic law function way state constitution incorporate treaty lexis
generally uk parliamentary statute require give effect treaty subsequent domestic law may override treaty
important point treaty impose tax liability none exist domestic law
reduce eliminate domestic tax liability
thus treaty state state provide maximum per cent withholding tax dividend state charge withholding tax domestic law provide withhold tax dividend
whatever rate specify treaty state would charge withholding tax
state provide withholding tax dividend would still charge per cent even though maximum rate treaty state per cent
rate withhold tax state treaty always maximum possible rate necessarily rate will actually apply practice
treaty override occur either deliberately accidentally
deliberate treaty override occur
state deliberately enact domestic legislation contradict one dtt remove treaty benefit state pass legislation mention dtt effect remove restrict treaty benefit
accidental treaty override typically occur state make change domestic law interpretation law restrict treaty benefit even direct intention
thing happen decision domestic court
despite fact state ought override dtt law vienna convention law of treaties much treaty partner short terminate treaty
drastic course action
treaty override consider bad practice internationally reduce certainty tax treatment dtt provide taxpayer
state reputation treaty override might find difficult negotiate new dtt
topic consider depth para
tax treaty eu law

within eu network bilateral dtt exist alongside eu law

first matter individual member states second principle set down treaty functioning eu tfeu must follow
word member states free decide right tax tax result broadly discrimination against foreign taxpayer taxpayer resident fellow eu member state
direct relationship interest royalty directive particular contain provision regard withholding tax dividend interest royalty must enact domestic law eu member states unless member state specifically obtain permission omit vary
effect frequently case domestic law eu member state will provide withhold tax rate certain type dividend interest royalty payment low provide dtt member states
even domestic law amend line circumstance right rely directive rather correspond domestic law
thus eu member state might charge per cent withholding tax rate interest domestic law would apply payment interest resident recipient eu resident recipient cover interest royalty directive
could well dtt fellow eu member state provide maximum withholding tax rate per cent
finally domestic law for certain eu recipient qualify under the interest and royalty directive would exempt certain interest payment withhold tax altogether
hence great care need determine correct rate withhold tax payment make eu enterprise

article set out scope treaty convention ie person apply
invariably treaty apply person resident one contracting state
although oecd commentary consider problem ensure resident two state manage benefit treaty provision limit benefit treaty either specific person particular way suspect person third state may try take advantage treaty normally contain either separate limitation benefit article article deal vulnerable type income typically dividend interest royalty
article tax cover
article set out tax cover either general term income periodic tax capital wages salary etc specific term give list tax
often approach use
problem lengthy list specific tax may quickly become date
hence article invariably contain provision treaty apply substantially similar tax replace list
procedure notify state replacement tax normally set out
typical wording provision convention shall apply also identical substantially similar tax impose date signature convention addition place exist tax
competent authority contract states shall notify significant change make taxation law

treaty may cover tax income periodic tax capital annual wealth tax gain inheritance likely double taxation inheritance estate will deal separate treaty
treaty normally cover indirect tax
local tax sometimes cover specifically indicate
para article lay down definition fundamental term person company enterprise
however para go state term define mtc meaning domestic law state unless context otherwise require
inevitably give rise difficulty term define treaty different meaning domestic law two state party treaty
domestic law point law time treaty apply existence time treaty enter different
normal method treaty interpretation respect know ambulatory approach oppose
typical wording provision regard application convention time contract state term define therein shall unless context otherwise require meaning time law state purpose tax convention apply meaning applicable tax law state prevail meaning give term law state
tax authority two state use mutual agreement procedure provide article order establish agreed definition certain term
see para commentary definition
article resident
article lay down provision determine residence individual entity
first paragraph set out possibility state consider person individual legal entity resident
treaty work one state must designate residence state source state
quite possible however taxpayer tax resident state domestic law
case article provide set rule decide one two state treaty purpose taxpayer consider resident
usefulness article thus lie contain aim prevent taxpayer consider resident contracting state
concept tax residence individual company consider detail chapter respectively
treaty contain standard series individual
many treaty contain company usually always place effective management
test us treaty exist normally place legal incorporation reflect us domestic law
even vary treaty treaty problem company move place legal incorporation order benefit particular tax treaty
recent treaty us adopt place company create rather company presently legally incorporate
company entity usually word follow
reason provision paragraph person individual resident contract states shall deem resident state place effective management situate
treaty contain often requirement tax authority two state must use mutual agreement procedure article reach agreement single state taxpayer consider resident treaty purpose
wording requirement crucial
article word tax authority must decide upon single state residence company resident treaty purpose one state
wording tax authority shall endeavour agree single state residence position much difficult
wording leave way open tax authority fail agree upon single state residence
case company could find consider resident state
treaty base upon idea allocate tax right two state would right tax dual resident company
obviously untenable usual requirement case dual residence two tax authority reach mutual agreement will use tax treaty reference dual resident company
treaty prescriptive state dual resident company benefit article treaty deal directly issue allocate tax right article
benefit deny operation article depend one state designate residence state source state
benefit company enjoy treaty would principle article right mutual agreement procedure use article
treaty point view dual residence bad thing although may well tax advantage compensate right set off loss state effectively use twice
article taxation business profit
concept permanent establishment pe important taxation host state business profit
profit enterprise state shall taxable state unless enterprise carry business state permanent establishment situate therein
article deal essentially taxation foreign branch
important understand articles normally apply foreign subsidiary
article determine source business profit will deem arise state taxpayer resident
general rule article business profit taxable state taxpayer resident unless source profit state
pe define article broadly include
place management
branch
office
factory
workshop
mine oil well etc
building construction site last
un model also deem pe exist provide service state even without fixed place business
models deem profit contract conclude behalf agent treat arise pe circumstance

article income immovable property
income immovable property example rent office building land use agriculture may tax state property locate
article give right tax income immovable property state source since obviously close economic connection source type income state locate
usually definition immovable property include land building agricultural equipment livestock
also include payment indirectly connect immovable property instance payment right work mineral deposit well obvious type income property rent
article international transport
would impracticable try work out exactly profit international transport enterprise operate many state earn general rule profit tax state international transport enterprise resident
special rule prevent enterprise avoid tax operate ship locate international water
article associated enterprise
operation state control party example part enterprise corporate group would easy manipulate pricing transaction achieve good overall tax result maximize group profit low tax country
tackle potential abuse article business profit article associate enterprise allow profit compute though two party unconnected
note article use determine split profit head office branch whereas article normally apply transaction separate company group
one state make upwards adjustment profit enterprise article provide state make correspond downwards adjustment
however adjustment taxable profit tax will probably still bad even correspond adjustment make invariably will state high tax rate make upwards adjustment
even specific provision correspond downwards adjustment taxable profit will normally address mutual agreement procedure provide article double taxation avoid
case state member states eu eu arbitration convention will apply
state detail law design help determine whether multinational company group company fix transfer price take advantage low tax rate one state
us detailed legislation code

article dividend
oecd mtc provide dividend may tax statesthat state source company pay dividend tax resident also state shareholder resident
practice difficult make shareholder fill in tax return pay tax annually common practice require company pay foreign shareholder dividend act tax collector deduct flat rate tax
pay company send dividend minus tax foreign shareholder tax state tax authority
form tax know withhold tax
charge source state normally take form withholding tax maximum charge allow per cent
uk treaty common many often rate low
however withholding tax dividend uk domestic law therefore whatever uk treaty say uk will charge withhold tax dividend
provision enable uk treaty partner charge withhold tax uk resident
state shareholder resident tax gross amount dividend allow credit foreign tax already pay
alternatively may exempt dividend taxation
article oecd mtc reproduce explanation italics
dividend competent authority contract states shall mutual agreement settle mode application limitation
paragraph shall affect taxation company respect profit dividend pay

word withholding tax liability shareholder pay company
pay company act tax collector
treaty insist beneficial owner dividend must resident state dividend pay old treaty might requirement recipient actually person beneficial owner
stop person third state benefit reduce rate withhold tax charge treaty situation shareholder company artificially set up receive dividend oblige pay dividend straight person third state
first domestic tax law state check unless state charge withhold tax payment dividend foreign shareholder domestic law whatever treaty say charge withhold tax treaty
will assume domestic law state would charge withholding tax per cent payment dividend foreign shareholder
next tax law state need check
state domestic law charge tax foreign dividend receive company resident state
will tax dividend receive state whatever treaty say
will assume state charge tax foreign dividend domestic law
hence tax dividend will case dividend pay company resident eu member states domestic law member states amend eu parent subsidiary directive provide minimum shareholding per cent pay company withholding tax may charge corporate shareholder
treaty rate maximum rate may charge will apply low domestic rate
besides deal rate withhold tax article deal occasion withholding tax would charge
article
provision paragraph article also contain definition mean term dividend
essence dividend define income share key attribute payment represent participation profit pay state
state germany austria entity company treat similar way company tax purpose dividend may include certain payment sleep partner silent partnership may include return certain loan amount interest depend profitability borrower
article interest
oecd commentary define interest generally remuneration money lend distinguish dividend generally subject double taxation ie generally tax hand debtor hand creditor
like dividend however interest may tax state recipient beneficial owner although withhold tax deduct source must exceed per cent per version mtc
practice rate per cent common particularly old treaty
source state identify state residence payer
quite common interest payable government one state exempt withhold tax
often interest export relate loan guarantee state also exempt interest credit sale agreement purchase plant machinery
interest may subject withhold tax
interest normally define widely often accord domestic law two state definition usually exclude amount treat dividend
scope exist attack thin capitalization well interest commercial rate
company usually wholly subsidiary would consider thinly capitalize proportion debt capital equity capital large
risk associate capital structure mean rarely find except loan holder parent company group company
tax advantage structure return debt capital interest usually deductible taxable profit whereas dividend return equity capital
examine chapter
matter state special relationship payer recipient amount interest excess might expect independent borrower lender excess will enjoy treaty withholding tax rate
either high domestic rate will apply excess excess might treat dividend
article royalty
article give exclusive taxation state residence beneficial owner royalty
thus oecd mtc permit withholding tax charge
however many treaty enter recent oecd mtc base un mtc still permit withhold tax charge
sometimes certain type payment carry withholding tax commonly literary artistic copyright payment exempt
term royalty context define article mean payment receive consideration use right use copyright patent trade mark design model plan secret formula process information concern industrial commercial scientific experience
sometimes international plant and equipment leasing payment cover case definition would include wording right use industrial commercial scientific equipment
although version oecd mtc provision widespread use exist treaty many oecd member express reservation article intention continue include leasing payment royalty future treaty
nature payment respect computer software difficult area
royalty
pure intellectual property question computer program normally protect copyright
however spectrum possible transfer computer software range outright transfer software limited right use software
payment respect right use copyright program eg reproduce distribute payment would consider royalty
payment however give user right operate program possibly make copy run personal computer
whether pay right make personal copy computer program constitute payment respect copyright depend domestic law state oecd view consumer pay copy computer program use one personal computer royalty payment simple sale product
whether program transfer consumer electronically via physical medium irrelevant
payment music film digital download consumer consider royalty although payment cover right make copy song film confer right reproduce
payment essential enable consumer acquire datum
capital gain intangible sometimes subject withhold tax article particularly reality lump sum work out accord expect future usage intangible amount dependent future sale intangible buyer
actual treaty one treaty partner develop state common find fee technical service include article rather article business profit
technical service usually provide develop state give state right levy withholding tax gross amount technical fee charge resident rather profit attributable technical fee make foreign provider
two advantage develop state
first amount tax will probably high base gross amount fee secondly little scope foreign provider minimize exposure tax develop state attribute small amount profit fee
practice gross up fee common shift burden withholding tax onto taxpayer
dividend interest rule deal situation enterprise resident state pe state enterprise receive royalty payer state relate intangible asset form part asset pe oppose head office
royalty would form part income pe thus would tax full state article
thus taxpayer would suffer full taxation state rather merely withhold tax
double tax relief will grant
although find mtc many exist treaty contain rule deal royalty payment connection intangible use pe rather head office
equivalent rule paragraph article interest
taxpayer resident state pe state use intangible state pay royalty recipient state state will charge withholding tax despite fact state taxpayer make payment royalty state taxpayer
logic royalty cross border
currently belgium canada czech republic mexico france slovak republic state reservation article intend continue include provision future treaty
article capital gain
taxation capital gain vary state state tax way ordinary income give special treatment yet may tax
oecd mtc attempt deal different approach specify kind tax apply to
basic rule capital gain taxable state taxpayer resident
mean state taxpayer resident must tax gain simply mean state right tax gain
good number state choose tax capital gain even though treaty give right
treaty provision article create tax liability none would otherwise exist
article refer alienation property
term use connection event give rise capital gain
will include normal disposal asset example sale also event exchange asset expropriation gift passing asset another death
state levy tax situation meaning term alienation sufficiently wide give right domestic law provide charge tax particular situation
two provision find tax treaty
first state permit tax gain alienation eg sale immovable property land building situate state
close link gain state property locate
second gain alienation movable property form part asset pe may tax state pe situate include gain alienation pe whether part alienation whole enterprise
gain alienation ship aircraft use international traffic business invariably taxable state place effective management locate
sensible international transport firm will asset locate around world location ship aircraft change daily
absence rule international transport firm could find liable capital gain tax charge whatever state ship aircraft happen time sale take place
apart basic provision treaty often include detailed provision deal indirect holding immovable property
oecd mtc include one rule gain alienation share derive per cent value directly indirectly immovable property situate state may tax state
would result tax gain sale share property company
many variation rule find practice
treaty make exception company publicly quote
explicitly state percentage value represent immovable property state
rule illustrate see figure treaty may include provision gain sale share company whether immovable property tax state company resident alienation make holding company amount typically per cent voting power company
treaty provision specifically preserve benefit deferral tax gain would grant state taxpayer resident eg gain make course group reorganization change ultimate ownership
provision relate individual switch residence one contracting state frequently find canadian austrian us treaty exclusively
instance contain inter alia rule
individual change residence one state either national resident say canada austria use example canada retain right tax gain make the five year follow change residence
austria retain right regard individual move canada
individual change tax residence say canada austria canada make exit charge capital gain accrue date change individual elect austria treat sell repurchase property question date change residence
word one state impose capital gain exit charge state will permit uplift base cost asset involve
rule different purpose
first measure whereas the second means prevent double taxation
finally notice instruction whatsoever gain compute
left entirely individual state will normally apply domestic rule
article independent personal service
article delete version oecd mtc still appear many exist treaty also still include un mtc
oecd consider duplication rule taxation sole trader partnership could deal adequately article pe article business profit
however many exist treaty incorporate parallel set rule set out article article use case professional service provide unincorporated person typically doctor lawyer engineer architect dentist accountant
also include would income literary artistic educational teaching independent scientific activity royalty income would deal article
income sole practitioner partner typically cover
rather look pe article look fixed base would probably office state regular use professional person
income attributable activity carry out fixed base locate state may tax state
treaty often base un mtc include alternative test even fixed base state may tax professional present tax year
un mtc continue include article although alternative formulation state wish include provision deal independent personal service article
article income employment
operation source principle mean technically speak remuneration respect work carry out state taxable state even small number day
paragraph article set out rule employment exercise state state may tax wages salary work
however main purpose article prevent remuneration short term assignment tax state assignment carry out
employer taxable state neither resident pe will receive tax deduction state wages salary pay
therefore tax remuneration employee would mean state short term assignment carry out would tax employee without give tax deduction employer
besides preserve symmetry taxation way exemption tax visit state income short term assignment provide significant administrative savings employee tax authority would otherwise need try keep track foreigner pay work within state matter short assignment
relatively little variation way oecd mtc use practice
basic rule source state right tax remuneration employment exercise within
exemption short term assignment set out
maximum length assignment order exemption source state taxation apply
variation exactly determined may calendar year tax period question commence end tax period question
current wording oecd mtc commence end the fiscal year concern
wording design prevent manipulation rule instance worker post abroad timing arrange present state five half month one year five half month next thus break year rule
exact measurement also subject interpretation day arrival departure count
normally rule domestic law use decide
aggregate period short assignment will add together
two condition must fulfil source state exempt remuneration short term assignment remuneration must pay behalf employer resident state employee post must bear pe employer state employee post
otherwise visit state would give tax deduction remuneration employer without tax employee
paula tax resident uk employ brown ltd uk company south african subsidiary
send work project carry out partly uk partly south africa
south african tax year end make three visit south africa ten day
wages pay uk employer recharge south african subsidiary
brown ltd pe south africa
thus although earn wages work perform south africa spend south africa wages tax deductible person against south african taxable income
effect south africa would seek charge tax portion wages relate work south africa
treatment employee stock option expressly deal with difficult entitlement benefit taxable result option may accrue partly whilst employee work temporarily one state may taxable event exercise option employee return state
state permit tax part taxable benefit relate portion entitlement period spend work state
commentary article deal stock option length
discussion employee stock option deal see chapter
article director fee
general rule director fee tax state company resident well director resident
broadly reason rule fortune director company closely link
thus director resident netherlands director german company might find taxable germany director fee
germany would able tax full amount even none director duty carry out germany netherlands provide double tax relief
us model take lenient view permit state company resident tax director remuneration duty carry out state rather total remuneration
many treaty distinguish true director fee payment work routine administrative nature latter treat income employment normal way
article entertainer sportsperson
entertainer sportsperson recognize special category often perform many different state earn large sum money matter day week rather the six month usual threshold article
use source principle state perform entitle tax income generate performance
interest simplicity might expect oecd would recommend taxable state resident fact earnings potentially high oecd mtc provide may tax source state
often artiste sportsperson will pay directly venue perform earnings will pay management company often one wholly artiste one employee artiste
case usual rule source principle still apply state performance take place retain right tax income
usually mean performer suffer withhold tax fee state performance take place
withholding tax might gross amount fee might charge net amount deduction expense
might final withholding tax ie amount withholding tax fix percentage income refund possible turn out normal source state income tax net profit would small figure
withholding tax artiste sportsperson opportunity make tax return state performance take place calculate normal income tax net income expense
withholding tax deduct exceed tax calculate net income host state will make tax refund
two common exception find
artiste sportsperson substantially support public fund state resident state resident may tax income
performance take place programme cultural exchange two contracting state income taxable state residence performance take place
note update mtc make number clarification scope application article
article pension
basic rule pension past employment tax state recipient resident
practice many exception
many treaty provide social security pension amount may dependent person past employment record tax state pay pension
state adopt rule entirely instance canadian treaty usually state pension respect past employment may tax state pay
state recipient resident also tax probably case residence state will give double tax relief
treaty contain rule may difference treatment periodic lump sum pension lump sum typically taxable state pay
recent us treaty contain provision protect right expatriate deduction against taxable income state work pension contribution make pension scheme home state
provision deal specifically alimony child support common
update material add deal payment payment make follow termination employment payment respect unused holiday
risk payment could treat differently state person work state person normally resident
states look true nature payment decide whether within article employment article pension
article government service
article contain provision cover taxation government and local authority employee
basic rule state pay remuneration charge tax even recipient resident state
pension taxable recipient resident provide also national state
article student
student go abroad study may well present long enough visit state become tax resident
would normally mean would find taxable visit state worldwide income include income home state
basic rule student tax visit state payment receive outside state eg home state
payment must purpose maintenance education training
many treaty extend rule student may able work visit state certain period earn remuneration up certain limit without become taxable
provision business trainee common although usually limit period favourable treatment will apply often year
indian treaty tend detailed rule student provision whereby visit state will exempt tax manner grant scholarship allowance even arise visit state
us treaty often cover three separate general business trainee student sponsor employer government sponsor trainee
us treaty often also contain clause individual claim treaty benefit student immediately afterwards teacher
oecd mtc contain specific rule teacher researcher many exist treaty provide teacher researcher may go work state up to two year even though technically tax resident visit state remain taxable home state
favourable treatment normally apply researcher engage publicly fund research rather say work pharmaceutical company exclusive right fruit labour
article income
rather innocuously title article cover type income might otherwise cover precede article
type income deal might include income agreement gamble winnings income certain type financial instrument fall neither heading dividend interest practice important use article perhaps punitive damages income fall clearly category
treaty include article although
usual rule income may tax state owner resident although un mtc treaty conclude certain state australia canada mexico new zealand insist income tax state arise
treaty take position allow state source impose withholding tax typically maximum
article capital
rather puzzling article use tax regime uk us impose periodic wealth tax
many state france india impose annual tax stock person wealth taxpayer might charge tax say per cent total worth each year
disposal necessary capital gain tax trigger liability necessary asset tax produce income
tax person balance sheet value
sometimes tax extend annual local tax immovable property
normally type asset tax cover article income immovable property article capital gain
article appear treaty
neither party treaty impose type tax domestic tax system point
however sometimes treaty negotiator include case
common case one treaty partner impose type tax article include word reciprocally partner currently charge tax right the future respect resident state
would though unless state change domestic law become general feature domestic tax system treaty create tax liability none would otherwise exist neither may state discriminate against resident treaty partner compare resident article
article double tax relief
will recall chapter see detailed explanation different type double tax relief use
oecd mtc offer choice credit relief state tax residence tax income abroad give credit foreign tax pay income relief exemption either source state usually state tax residence will exempt foreign income taxation altogether
contracting state will choose method use matter negotiation
article state will set out broad term method will use relieve double taxation
state free adopt different method indeed rare find treaty state will use method
state might set out article will use different method different type income
instance quite common state set out treaty will exempt dividend receive state pay shareholding represent per cent capital pay company
dividend might give double tax relief via credit method
common exception state specify exemption method treaty interest royalty will also give double tax relief via credit method
detail double tax relief will however govern domestic law
double tax treaty develop state base un model often contain
mean state will give credit tax state develop state even tax actually pay state
preserve usefulness investor state tax incentive offer state
absence tax spare provision result reduction tax state would increase tax state due low state tax credit
tax spare provision word refer tax exemption give particular statute usually encourage foreign inward investment
typical indian treaty
alternatively provision might state example state will allow certain percentage gross dividend interest royalty income credit even withholding tax charge state
common chinese tax treaty many date early still base un mtc
sometimes time limit place provision typically ten year date treaty case provision open end
us treaty unique problem deal double tax relief article us reserve right save clause article para us model charge full us tax resident individual us citizen
us citizen tax resident outside us state may find subject full residence base taxation us
us wish achieve effect individual pay amount tax worldwide merely resident us
state normally position give credit resident tax suffer overseas see concede large tax credit us insist tax individual still resident us
therefore state will usually agree grant tax credit amount tax would pay us impose extra tax charge grounds individual us citizenship word normal amount tax us would charge us citizen
point individual suffer high combine tax liability full tax credit normal us tax
solution usually adopt us reduce tax charge basis citizenship grant turn credit tax suffer
amount credit will limit amount need bring us citizen global tax bill back would individual us citizen us tax resident
problem solution involve treat income arise state arise us lengthy provision need ensure income treat arise source technically correct state call source rule
article
purpose article prevent discrimination against foreign taxpayer
state may subject national state taxation connected procedure addition burdensome circumstance subject national
notably article express term national rather resident arguably wide concept
mean national contracting state entitle invoke against contracting state even fall within definition resident tax purpose ie could even tax resident third state
thus state permit discriminate grounds residence nationality
however residence status bearing treatment question state permit discriminate grounds residence alone
commentary give several example illustrate principle
article one generate great number international tax law dispute contentious phrase circumstance
nothing stop state negotiate exception principle
instance india commonly insist upon right discriminate against pe foreign enterprise subject profit high rate tax apply profit indian enterprise
poland treaty reserve right discriminate favour formerly state enterprise
commonly state operate branch profit tax usually reserve right charge tax
many treaty extend principle tax specifically cover treaty
article mutual agreement procedure
article oecd mtc design provide procedure resolve difficulty application treaty
provide competent authority state must attempt resolve situation taxpayer tax accordance provision treaty example relation attribution profit pe treaty misapply perhaps determination residence
instance double taxation eliminate specific article treaty also deal use mutual agreement procedure map
procedure protection taxpayer initiate taxpayer without interfere remedy available domestic law
need double taxation order invoke procedure requirement taxation dispute impose contravention treaty
example state may tax particular class income convention allocate right tax state although state may fact tax example due gap domestic tax law
common situation map invoke
profit attribute pe determine proportion head office expense overhead deduct profit pe
establish amount reciprocal adjustment case state make upwards adjustment profit enterprise article article may require treaty partner state make correspond downwards adjustment taxable profit related person resident state transaction question make
reciprocal adjustment incomplete reciprocal adjustment make profit will tax state state
aim treaty eliminate double taxation mutual agreement procedure provide framework negotiation two tax authority
may also take account call secondary adjustment rarely address treaty
one state make upwards adjustment taxable profit make exactly equal correspond downwards adjustment tax revenue two state might still different would arm length pricing apply first place
high profit state upwards adjustment take place might well give rise high dividend interest payment withholding tax might chargeable
even though state make upwards adjustment retrieve tax deficit enterprise resident still retrieve deficit withholding tax
whether make secondary upwards adjustment make good deficit withhold tax receipt depend whether provide domestic law
double taxation will result will necessarily relieve normal treaty article elimination double taxation may necessary invoke mutual agreement procedure
establish amount interest royalty payment regard excessive special relationship payer recipient thus qualify treaty withholding rate
establish single state tax residence article fail treaty include tiebreaker clause
decide whether pe exist
decide whether employee breach set out article qualify exemption tax visit state
condition attach map
admissible objection must present competent authority state residence taxpayer concern within three year first notify action heart dispute
oecd commentary discuss length point time limit consider start run
time limit design protect tax authority late objection
treaty include time limit bring claim time limit vary
map also use case disgruntled taxpayer bring case
use agree definition term expressly define anywhere treaty
also use reach agreement whether new tax cover treaty whether change state domestic law affect treaty
complaint first consider competent authority state complainant national may resolve unilaterally consultation competent authority contracting state
competent authority state generally ministry of finance subdivision particular responsibility tax matter eg case uk hmrc case us irs
case bring article sometimes refer competent authority procedure
map particularly valuable taxpayer provide mechanism tax authority state communicate without go diplomatic channel may simply write email telephone even meet face face
treaty specifically permit oral exchange view
provide joint commission taxpayer may make representation assist counsel desire
new treaty contain provision either require contracting state offer opportunity enter binding arbitration process
may may time limit whereby agreement reach arbitration process trigger
version mtc put two year
note member states eu case bind provision eu arbitration convention even express requirement provision arbitration treaty eu member states arbitration may nonetheless take place
arbitration possible treaty one contracting state member eu even treaty make provision arbitration tax authority may decide mutual agreement enter arbitration
typically arbitration board will consist senior member tax authority far involve case
significant practical problem use map take long time
unusual map take eight ten year conclude bind arbitration speed up resolution dispute considerably
article exchange information
one sensitive issue will arise two state negotiate double tax treaty extent will exchange information tax affair resident
article provide tax administrator treaty party shall exchange information foreseeably relevant carry out
provision double tax agreement dta
provision domestic law contracting state concern tax cover double tax agreement insofar contrary agreement
term foreseeably relevant important give high degree flexibility treaty partner type information may request whilst time discourage speculative enquiry one state may vague suspicion concern taxpayer real evidence tax liability meet
commentary article give useful example type information might typically exchange
information concern amount royalty transmit taxpayer state taxpayer
information require establish proper allocation taxable profit associated company allocation profit head office operation branch
power exchange information respect quite wide
state could legitimately ask state information price charge supplier state connection state state taxpayer
state would want information could crosscheck price charge similar product state taxpayer company help establish whether intragroup pricing would charge unconnected party
see chapter transfer pricing
person work abroad information amount earnings state
update mtc confirm term foreseeably relevant encompass call fishing expedition ie speculative enquiry
define speculative request apparent nexus open inquiry investigation
however necessary name address specific taxpayer include request long enough information identify taxpayer concern
particularly troublesome new commentary clarify request concern group taxpayer individually identify follow detail must give
detailed description relevant group eg account holder specific type specific financial institution
specific fact circumstance lead request eg discovery state resident taxpayer hold account financial institution grounds believe taxpayer resident state also similar undisclosed account
explanation applicable law eg requirement disclose foreign income tax return
reason believe taxpayer group comply law support clear factual basis
another change include update information exchange may use purpose allow domestic law state concern
treaty silent exchange information proceed treaty partner decide mechanic
oecd commentary contemplate information may exchange
automatically revenue authority arrange routine exchange certain class information regular interval
request state request information something particular want know
spontaneously information supply treaty partner without ask first
practice article useful two tax administration
general principle state will enforce tax claim state
generally know international law revenue rule
lead authority subject state english court jurisdiction entertain action enforcement either directly indirectly penal revenue public law foreign state

authority statement decision english court government of india taylor case indian government try enforce claim unpaid indian tax against uk company trade india
principal way one state assist another enforce tax claim against resident supply information state make enforcement domestic tax law possible
may necessary state amend domestic law order permit gather information request treaty partner information require establish domestic tax liability
uk find necessary amend law respect enable fulfil obligation regard information exchange tax treaty
wording exchange information article current treaty vary somewhat
treaty restrict exchange information necessary operation treaty whereas many extend provision information necessary operation treaty domestic law two state
go far make specific reference information need combat fraud tax evasion
relatively treaty currently use late wording information foreseeably relevant
note many state enter separate arrangement exchange information mutual assistance tax matter
important multilateral treaty respect council enter country include almost oecd country brazil russia india china major financial centre include switzerland
eu directive administrative field taxation cover tax except vat excise duty improve upon previous directive set up common procedure form format claim channel exchange information
tax official request state permit active participation inspection administrative enquiry
importantly banking secrecy may invoke reason fail supply information
directive go much article oecd mtc provide automatic exchange information eu member states income employment director fee pension ownership income immovable property income certain life assurance product
large number bilateral exchange information treaty also exist although exchange information treaty make state may potentially use tax haven might best describe customer state eg uk british virgin islands
many treaty flow oecd work harmful tax competition discuss chapter
finally along le weekend le sandwich reader may interested know another enter french language several information exchange article swiss treaty include norway austria specifically forbid mounting fishing expedition treaty partner
broad term must specific grounds suspicion request particular information rather ask information see evidence tax evasion taxpayer
article assistance collection tax
subject remark previous paragraph state general enforce tax claim model tax convention offer model article whereby two contract states may lend assistance collection revenue claim
recent development first appear version model tax convention
however commentary acknowledge state national may allow justify type assistance
type assistance envisage administrative nature
general provision common state close neighbour history
relatively common treaty eu member states
common land border significant number worker live one state work provision useful
extent provision vary treaty request state must exhaust means available ask treaty partner help contain requirement
range matter cover also vary treaty assistance give collection tax relate interest penalty
uk traditionally include provision tax treaty recently conclude treaty eg include article
provision limitation benefit clause certain tax treaty discuss chapter notably administrative assistance collect tax technically due state
main driver behind particular provision uk wish assist us collection us tax merely ensure person properly entitle relief us tax treaty actually get relief
type restricted administrative assistance article common us treaty
council also cover assistance collection tax although clause optional
within eu directive mutual assistance recovery claims relate tax duty measure provide common standard mutual assistance
see chapter general discussion assistance collection state tax chapter multilateral agreement mutual assistance tax matter

us treaty invariably contain separate limitation benefit article separate article relatively rare treaty involve us
usually insert prevent practice treaty shopping whereby company individual may try manipulate benefit particular tax treaty
particular interest respect use various type hold company structure
provision examine detail chapter along relevant beps relate change
favoured
favoured refer mfn clause sometimes write treaty ensure contracting state continue give good deal possible treaty partner
example mfn clause take article give
article treaty provide withholding tax rate per cent literary artistic royalty event signing convention czech republic sign third state agreement limit taxation royalty arise czech republic rate low include exemption rate provide paragraph article convention case may low rate exemption will automatically applicable purpose convention date agreement czech republic third state will effect
para contemporaneous protocol add article
event czech republic enter double tax treaty austria become effective provide rate per cent royalty
thus maximum rate apply royalty include literary artistic royalty reduce per cent
notice particular clause provide automatic application new rate
mfn clause merely provide favourable treaty enter one treaty partner negotiation amend treaty will trigger
one lesson insufficient merely glance treaty determine withholding tax rate
user need check first whether mfn clause present need check whether clause exist trigger
mfn clause appear relatively small number treaty

common mistake try interpret treaty use principle statutory interpretation apply domestic law
however note early treaty govern international law vienna convention
unlike extremely detailed provision domestic tax law treaty purposive interpretation must agree two contracting state
uk court generally reserve use overtly purposive approach case involve aggressive
civil law state germany interpretation domestic statute law call purposive approach
thus interpretation domestic tax law literal approach usually employ
furthermore word use domestic law sometimes acquire special tax meaning uk use phrase beneficial ownership denote particular situation trust and estate law
special meaning sometimes open challenge instance mcniven westmoreland investments lord hoffmann famously decree pay mean pay context determine whether could deduction interest accrue
states may use material prepare unilaterally aid interpretation text treaty preamble annex material prepare bilateral basis protocol memorandum understanding agree upon party time treaty conclude
interpretative material must contemporaneous signing treaty unless conclude contracting state subsequently mutual agreement
treaty must construe individually
fact tax authority state construe certain term certain way treaty state state mean term must construe identically treaty state say highly likely state will strive certain amount consistency interpretation treaty one key benefit tax treaty degree certainty provide international business tax matter
court case useful aid treaty interpretation particularly case recognize international fiscal significance
good example case meaning term beneficial ownership indofood case accept provide international fiscal meaning term widely use tax treaty rarely specifically define
treaty will usually define important term person enterprise permanent establishment within text mtc also provide article general rule definition term specifically define within text meaning time treaty conclude tax law state concerned

logic argument fee service business profit stem brazilian domestic law definition business profit
relevant treaty define mean business profit meaning phrase within domestic law brazil consider
definition state business profit net income deduction addition require tax law
net income define gross income minus related cost expense period
hence argument service fee gross payment could business profit instead revenue
taxpayer counter argument state service fee enter computation business profit
taxpayer argue term business profit mean income derive business activity apart specifically mention article relevant treaty business profit article
upper court agree taxpayer decide incorrect construe term business profit reference narrow meaning within brazilian tax code

commentary offer example instance painter decorator contract redecorate large office building present three day week two year would consider pe office building
however problem example consider later chapter
uncertainty compound oecd statement commentary pe arise state even foreign enterprise trade short period time
oecd revisit issue discussion draft offer two example
first foreign enterprise carry trade another state short period time particular year recurrent basis
example give enterprise carry drilling operation remote arctic location
weather and sea condition severe drilling take place about three month year enterprise expect keep come back five season
recurrent nature business would justify arctic state claim pe arise whole
however obvious problem exist example enterprise withdraw operation the five year
would still pe the first few year
hand wait see approach take enterprise might find charge tax retrospective basis foreign state base upon actual pattern trading operation indeterminate number past year
would hard plan tax liability might arise
another example deal sally tax resident ruritania hear parent live state inistania rent out home film company period four month
realize parent house middle nowhere will many hungry mouth feed sally rush inistania set up cafe mother presumably large kitchen
film finish sally pack up return normal job ruritania
point film catering business ever exist inistania four month
circumstance oecd consider sally could pe inistania
make living film caterer travel different international location probably would pe inistania
fix place business whose business carry on
become common mne manufacturing operation relatively high tax state reduce taxable profit arise manufacturing operation reduce profitability manufacturing subsidiary
usually change status manufacturing subsidiary fully fledged contract manufacturer
fully fledged manufacturer would expect purchasing find customer make want want want
hand contract manufacturer would typically responsibility manufacturing
another group company would buy raw material send contract manufacturer incorporation finished product would buy output contract manufacturer
contract manufacturer perform business function bear little risk
consequently multinational group justify fact little profit make
question arise whether contract manufacturer really trade whether act merely pe parent company
state prove really parent company trade carry on fix premise contract manufacturer state tax small profit contract manufacturer also portion profit parent company

conclude dependent agent pe create judgment instructive careful analysis issue
commissionaire company usually either sale manufacturing subsidiary carry out limited range business function bear little risk asset
idea even use open market pricing transaction little profit earn commissionaire
earn commission sale manufacture service
usually would locate relatively high tax country
two main tax issue arise type planning foreign subsidiary reward arm see chapter foreign subsidiary strip business function operate dependent agent pe another group company
manufacturing commissionaire arrangement
many mne seek limit exposure foreign tax make change supply chain
typically function perform foreign subsidiary high tax jurisdiction will radically reduce order reduce attribution group profit subsidiary
instance whereas foreign subsidiary might carry out manufacture group buy material use intellectual property employ sale force subsidiary could convert contract manufacturer
typically intellectual property use manufacturing process material process would belong manufacturing subsidiary group company low tax jurisdiction
manufacturing subsidiary would pay manufacturing activity usually cost plus basis see chapter would result drop taxable profit
group thus switch internal profit high tax jurisdiction low tax one
often mne apply similar planning technique distributor subsidiary strip asset marketing intangible reduce business risk bear limit function commissionaire
sale commissionaire undisclosed agent principal make sale name
civil law concept question whether act dependent agent pe independent agent principal
commissionaire arrangement firm enter sale contract name behalf principal
usually commissionaire supplier firm principal
typically commissionaire resident state might sell goods customer however commissionaire would automatically enter contract supplier firm state buy goods onward supply customer
customer would deal commissionaire firm would recourse supplier firm
authorization require supplier firm commissionaire firm enter contract customer
essential feature sale commissionaire structure business risk eg inventory credit risk currency risk bear supplier company rather commissionaire
function commissionaire company purely sale turnover normally present amount commission earn
minimize amount group profit need allocate commissionaire
usually income commissionaire will show commission receive minus expense rather profit purchase onward sale goods
sale commissionaire sometimes refer low risk distributor
distributor company stock bear risk and own substantial asset usually refer fully fledged distributor
states often assert commissionaire company act dependent agent therefore pe another company group
prove give right tax profit resident commissionaire company also portion profit group company
commissionaire structure create problem decide whether agency pe concept agency understand differently different state depend whether state common law civil law system
civil law recognize agent act either direct indirect representation
direct representation mean agent act name principal inform party agent
indirect representation agent act agent name personally bind contract
contract make agent principal transfer legal right obligation enter agent principal
common law make distinction direct indirect undisclosed agency concept somewhat simple make difference whether agent act agent name name principal
however broad effect difference definition civil law concept agency wide common law concept
define article oecd model state use domestic law definition
thus treaty civil law state common law state mismatch interpretation term permanent establishment agent involve
difference two legal system respect agent illustrate figure
change paragraph article set out table paragraph article refer explicitly authority conclude contract name enterprise indicate either common law definition agency direct representation civil law system
prior beps action commentary attempt clarify position state paragraph apply agent conclude contract bind principal even contract actually name principal
example give agent solicit receive order customer principal agent send directly warehouse order routinely approve principal fulfil
agent formally enter contract name principal yet purpose paragraph article would consider authority conclude contract name enterprise
word agent probably subsidiary would regard pe principal company
position confirm oecd final report action
new paragraph commentary article explain agent typically commissionaire act behalf principal enter contract customer name agent result principal transfer goods provide service customer directly would result commissionaire regard pe principal
even though contract enter commissionaire customer legally bind principal contract deliver goods service
usual exception independent agent would still apply
genuine distributor company catch rule
change commissionaire beps action
oecd acknowledge state common view whether undisclosed agency commissionaire arrangement result foreign subsidiary commissionaire regard pe foreign principal parent company
final report action set out change paragraph article reproduce table
change direct specifically sale commissionaire arrangement
wording paragraph current refer person conclude contract name enterprise
however sale commissionaire company will often conclude contract name
hence propose new paragraph

person act contracting state behalf enterprise habitually conclude contract play principal role lead conclusion contract routinely conclude without material modification enterprise contract name enterprise transfer ownership granting right use property enterprise enterprise right use provision service enterprise enterprise shall deem permanent establishment state respect activity person undertake enterprise new subparagraph widen scope paragraph beyond situation contract make name enterprise
new wording commissionaire company white co sell customer black co contract name black co white co might still create pe another company red co
would happen part contract white co and black co relate transfer ownership use property provision service will perform red co rather
thus new wording catch undisclosed agent customer black co necessarily know identity company will supply product service red co
key point goods sell contract white co black co never legally
situation distributor company even low risk distributor take legal ownership property sell customer would create pe supplier
hence white co take legal possession goods red co white co contract sell black co red co would pe

oecd recognize dealings different part company eg head office branch transaction company corporate group state transfer pricing principle apply analogy
culmination series discussion document draft report produce onwards
oecd declare question attribute profit pe determine without constrain either original intent historical interpretation article
new approach introduce oecd two stage new material introduce commentary conflict previous material
new version article introduce along change commentary
new approach involve two step functional analysis determine role pe relation enterprise whole allocation part profit enterprise pe
alternative choice distinct separate enterprise approach refer functionally separate would adopt relative
alternative would try identify profit generate enterprise activity pe wholly partly involve
perhaps key difference two approach functionally separate possible taxable profit attribute pe whether enterprise whole make profit period question
relative would permit allocation total profit enterprise pe enterprise whole make loss would question taxable profit allocate pe
part reason overhaul article interpretation prevent situation double taxation profit example one state tax profit pe situate functionally separate entity approach state use relative business activity approach consider enterprise make loss therefore fail give double tax relief taxation suffer pe
double would also possible
step aoa functional factual analysis
pe must view functionally separate entity
single legal entity trade fiction
commentary article give guidance factor need form view pe distinct separate entity functional factual analysis along line set out oecd carry out establish economically significant activity responsibility undertake pe
broadly would involve
establish right obligation arise transaction pe separate enterprise instance take relatively easy example pe take form manufacturing and sale operation sale revenue independent customer arise factory output might properly attribute pe rather head office
similarly obligation pay raw material use factory might properly attribute factory
identify significant person function relevant attribution economic ownership asset attribution economic ownership asset pe
economic ownership define right income attributable ownership asset right depreciate asset also potential exposure gain loss appreciation depreciation asset
treatment tangible intangible asset will differ tangible property attribute location use rather place acquire subsequently manage different
thus head office department state charge procurement fix asset keep fixed asset register perhaps implement maintenance schedule will affect attribution asset pe asset actually use
intangible hand physical location attribute business location work develop acquire management take place
idea identify person function take oecd work transfer pricing context establish arm length deal term connected enterprise rather part enterprise
essence economic ownership intangible rest location risk associate intangible bear
instance enterprise patent particular drug sell distributor company many state economic ownership would rest part enterprise responsible commission research develop drug would bear loss medical trial fail licence manufacture obtainable bring legal action defend patent against generic copy whose profit would decrease competitor drug come on market
identify significant person function relevant assumption risk attribution risk pe
separate requirement recognize one part enterprise may economic ownership asset different part enterprise may bear risk associate use asset
instance road building equipment may economically pe state head office locate state may power determine road building project equipment use
hence risk associate profit loss arise equipment lie head office
pe enterprise one state may rely successful development new drug future profit
another part enterprise develop drug developer drug also pe hope market would adversely affect trial fail
personnel pe take active part manage development drug possibly due effect profit pe consider bear risk connection development drug

oecd para
step allocate profit pe
take account picture build up step profit pe must establish
relatively simple respect deal pe independent third party profit dealings part enterprise will determine use rule lay down oecd transfer pricing guideline see chapter detail
dealings pe rest enterprise compare transaction independent enterprise
difficulty unlikely transaction pe essence branch rest enterprise way legally bind transaction company even group
dealings include physical transfer stock provision service use intangible asset use capital asset transfer financial asset forth
pricing dealings examine use normal transfer pricing methodspreferably comparable uncontrolled price impossible one method lay down oecd transfer pricing guideline
two particular problem arise fact pe separate legal entity first pe source finance separate enterprise difficult determine level return finance eg interest payable ought deduct taxable profit pe
second support documentation available evidence pricing policy pe head office part enterprise will less formal need transaction separate legal entity eg fellow subsidiary
deduction possible
legal term pe part enterprise possible head office make profit dealings pe make charge interest royalty pe
however aoa depend fiction pe separate independent enterprise traditional rule prevent many deduction profit attributable pe drop
main change commentary deduction permissible calculate profit attributable pe may summarize follow
exception banking enterprise internal interest charge normally permit except interest pay respect specific treasury service
hence head office permit lend money and charge interest pe tax purpose
however portion interest pay enterprise external lender may deduct arrive taxable profit pe
arrive figure necessary determine amount capital equity debt pe would require order carry out function separate entity
amount draw up balance sheet pe separate legal entity use basic balance sheet equation familiar accountant asset minus liability capital
figure total capital attributable pe must divide up equity capital debt capital
oecd report refer free capital rather equity capital free capital capital return would give rise tax deduction
therefore share capital would free capital return share capital form dividend case would tax deductible
similarly retain profit would constitute free capital
figure free capital attributable pe know deduct total capital pe leave amount debt capital thus lead tax deduction interest payable
four method put forward total capital pe split free capital debt capital common aim method arrive ratio debt equity capital might find independent entity similar pe application arm length principle analyse chapter
report note ratio free capital debt capital will influence risk assume pe instance foodproducing pe part general manufacturing enterprise might carry high risk part enterprise
high risk great proportion free capital equity capital debt capital ought
oecd commentary article revise recommend method use arrive split free capital debt capital method use state pe locate provide state involve agree proposed method one four method recommend oecd commentary article para
establish amount debt capital attributable branch necessary decide interest term ought give amount tax deduction
various method put forward might possible trace funding provide head office pe back original source establish amount interest pay head office bank third party lender
know trace approach
alternatively formula approach could use base cost capital enterprise whole proportion total debt capital attribute pe
know fungibility approach
whichever approach use pe assume creditworthiness enterprise whole
question whether internal interest charge make head office pe oppose allocation pe part total external interest charge pay enterprise whole depend whether certain type service provide pe
banking enterprise oecd accept will appropriate internal interest charge make whether call treasury dealings part nonbanking enterprise depend result functional factual analysis
treasury dealings broadly speak economic ownership cash financial asset change hand
approach look significant person function management cash financial asset enterprise external borrowing unlikely function would present
general rule internal interest charge normally permit within enterprise need prevent tax avoidance manipulation allocation profit pe rest enterprise
transaction recognize
fundamental premise make allocation profit pe dealings pe rest enterprise view way transaction fellow group company oecd transfer pricing guideline apply accordingly
problem address enterprise eg company might well insist level documentation transaction head office branch pe would company say external customer supplier even fellow group company
test set threshold test level documentation need order particular transaction head office pe affect amount profit allocate pe tax purpose
transfer pricing test apply check whether profit earn pe akin would earn independent enterprise first decide particular transaction even kind transaction would enter party deal arm length
type internal transaction pe rest enterprise recognize determine profit attributable pe relate real identifiable event
would include physical transfer goods material provision service use intangible transfer financial asset
internal record probably management and branch account would starting point identify transaction true test whether internal dealing economic significance
company legal entity make contract possible apply oecd exactly
would require scrutiny term contract legal term internal dealings give rise contract
however para transfer pricing guideline helpfully point out certain material may use supplement review contract internal correspondence example minute meeting telephone conversation
generally notional charge item would normally attract withholding tax interest royalty principle use charge really royalty interest enterprise charge royalty interest therefore withholding tax impose
profit allocate pe tax purpose may reduce allocation head office expense eg strategic management centrally manage support function payroll
follow position take oecd transfer pricing guideline arm length pricing service require whether supply external customer
oecd para
transfer pricing principle embody oecd transfer pricing guideline use highly likely case host state will contend arm length principle apply will wish increase amount profit attribute pe
frequently happen reference transaction company corporate group article
article model contain requirement state make correspond downwards adjustment profit tax prevent double taxation profit
somewhat reluctantly late proceedings lead adoption revise article oecd include para article requirement state must make appropriate adjustment
accordance paragraph contract state adjust profit attributable permanent establishment enterprise one contract states tax accordingly profit enterprise charge tax state state shall extent necessary eliminate double taxation profit make appropriate adjustment amount tax charge profit

case dependent agent question arise two taxpayer involve one

overseas enterprise pay dependent agent arm length remuneration service overseas enterprise say make profit dependent agent pe
circumstance state consider taxpayer make profit state dependent agent rather overseas enterprise say take single
circumstance will obvious enterprise make profit agency pe state profit report agent
instance dependent agent may pay sale procure commission basis
however selling enterprise may make profit sale even take account commission pay agent
thus dependent agent also foreign enterprise would taxable state dependent agent resident
consider profit attribute dependent agent pe way type pe
thus even arm length remuneration pay dependent agent service overseas enterprise may still liable tax pe state
profit must attribute dependent agent pe basis asset risk capital attribute dependent agent pe
necessary look significant person function may perform dependent agent staff require analysis skill expertise employee agent
mere sale agent unlikely perform significant person function
however dependent agent enterprise act dependent agent perform activity lead development marketing or trade intangible oecd consider whatever strict legal position economic substance matter dependent agent least partly economic owner intangible profit must attribute pe accordingly
ordinary transfer pricing principle could use increase profit report enterprise act dependent agent pe control foreign enterprise
solution apparent underpayment hence reporting profit state dependent agent pe locate attribute profit dependent agent pe base functional factual analysis carry out pe raise tax assessment foreign enterprise allow deduction payment actually make dependent agent
oecd profit attribution report observe jurisdiction adopt simplified approach interest administrative convenience example collect tax intermediary reduce reporting burden enterprise

liberalization trade service prove difficult achieve although sign negotiation progress eu
take account fact world export goods increase dramatically the past few decade continue increase trade service represent important element global trade
liberalization service trade progress give service output represent per cent worldwide gdp may expect trade service will increase substantially
sometimes argue oecd mtc deal adequately trade service bulk service provide overseas customer provide form acquire subsidiary company foreign affiliate customer state
foreign affiliate would tax resident customer state thus liable tax profit service perform customer state
certainly true provision service via foreign affiliate grow significantly the past few decade value service provide foreign affiliate eg send employee customer state
us major exporter service maintain statistics type trade year

oecd mtc already deal adequately fully taxable state resident

oecd mtc usually deal adequately mode either subsidiary company resident customer state supplier pe customer state
however commercial presence abroad breach threshold pe might direct taxation customer state see comment gats mode

individual enterprise supply service visit customer state course supply service
instance would include private consultant customer several country visit customer carry out consultancy service customer premise
another example would enterprise send employee abroad provide technical assistance customer perhaps part installation plant machinery
employee could send customer site abroad provide training customer employee say operation new computer software
another example would head office company state temporarily transfer worker subsidiary company state
although far appear small category term value expect change agreement conclude gats framework
date progress slow due mainly fear amongst develop country permit fsp develop country visit purpose service provision constitute risk uncontrolled migration
nevertheless present number challenge international tax system
significant problem many country principally develop country charge withholding tax gross amount payment make respect service
often withholding tax final chance repayment
withholding tax give taxpayer option later file tax return tax net profit rather gross amount thus claim repayment
render provision service state unprofitable illustrate example
withholding tax provision service would profitable
even levy net basis say would profitable ie

profit foreign tax
would still small amount foreign tax unrelieved residence state overall activity would still profitable
unfortunate effect charging withholding tax payment service fsp will routinely insist upon gross charge price payable service increase take account withholding tax leave fsp net position withholding tax
burden withholding tax shift on customer service become expensive may even become unaffordable
although space discuss issue develop country require technology transfer state order develop economy withhold tax

definition pe contain specific reference service income taxable host state fsp would either fixed place business host state business wholly partly carry on would dependent agent host state

costly develop country usually net service importer
difficult develop country challenge transfer pricing practice multinational group respect service fee
many develop country already charge withhold tax payment royalty dress up royalty fee technical service perceive way avoid withholding tax royalty
without article much uncertainty taxation service fee source country
service pe
payment respect information concern industrial commercial scientific experience thus form royalty
mixed contract
reduce uncertainty cite draft commentary un mtc main reason introduction article
article will require detailed definition mean technical service fee
essentially fee closely connect intellectual property particular know
note prepare meeting committee expert brian arnold arnold summarize key issue need address develop new article
definition service new article would apply
whether tax apply income technical service physically perform host state whether apply whenever resident make payment respect technical service fee
whether threshold apply tax kick
whether tax pure withholding tax whether attempt tax net profit make provision technical service
text propose new article read follow
case provision article article case may shall apply

reason special relationship payer beneficial owner fee technical service person amount fee regard service pay exceed amount would agree upon payer beneficial owner absence relationship provision article shall apply last mention amount amount would agree upon absence relationship
case excess part fee shall remain taxable accord law contract state due regard provision convention

threshold even small scale supplier service will suffer wht treaty contain new article
payment tax deductible catch payment service intend personal use individual oppose business use except article
foreign pe fixed base customer country service provide profit service will tax customer country net profit basis normal rule pe fix basis article un mtc
absence permanent establishment fix base articles amend even though fee technical service give rise business profit profit attributable pe fix base deal new article rather article
without amendment articles country would right tax technical service fee unless pe fix base
final withholding tax
new article closely follow format articles interest royalty provide wht
whether could refund tax tax return submit show tax due net profit basis less charge withhold tax uncertain
word whether final withholding tax
also uncertain whether maximum withholding tax would set level approximate effective rate tax net profit would
draft commentary warn against excessively high rate withhold tax grounds
would probably insist call clause contract oblige resident payer pay amount would due absence withholding tax
mean resident payer end up suffer withholding tax rather
tax rate excess foreign tax credit limit provider country could deterrent provision service
high rate withhold tax might wipe out profit potential fsp deter provision service
despite caveat practical way enforce collection tax means withholding
requirement withhold fall resident customer would normally liable remit withholding tax tax authority whether actually withhold payment make foreign fsp
fundamental deficiency article failure establish source rule service income
paragraph merely refer fee arise one contracting state pay resident
draft commentary paragraph attempt define mean fee arise
thus debate whether source rule place performance place utilization service merely place payment base erosion properly address
undermine level certainty afford fsp whether withholding tax will levy
source rule service discuss para onwards
article define technical service fee payment consideration service managerial technical consultancy nature
accord draft commentary service must involve
application fsp specialized knowledge skill expertise behalf client
transfer knowledge skill expertise client transfer information cover definition royalty paragraph article
management define involve application knowledge skill expertise control administration conduct commercial enterprise organization
thus enterprise manage director officer employee enterprise payment will technical service fee
payment consultant advice concern management enterprise would also technical service fee
technical define involve application specialized knowledge skill expertise respect particular art science profession occupation
hence technical service fee will include payment lawyer accountant architect medical professional engineer dentist professional
consultancy define involve provision advice service specialized nature whether management technical
countries adopt new article must use definition
article deliberately make reference domestic law definition
country operate new article use consistent set definition rather
instance india particularly labyrinthine set definition might constitute technical service will longer able apply fsp resident country india conclude amend treaty contain new article
new article seek set out common set definition override domestic definition
important part definition limit definition technical service fee bespoke service tailor particular client
instance bank might use knowledge skill expertise develop general product service make available client return fee credit card service
bundle general credit card service would involve research analysis advice specific client relate client particular service hence payment foreign bank return credit card service would technical service fee
however advice give foreign bank propose merger acquisition customer would count foreign service fee service particular need particular client
unfortunately question whether expense technical service fee deal new article
even unfortunately draft commentary matter explicitly leave individual country decide
likely result continue uncertainty foreign fsp effective rate tax will suffer customer country
expense subject withholding tax effective rate suffer will less headline rate withhold tax
will lead fsp skew charge customer country away pure fee reimbursement expense
tax authority customer country will leave task auditing split fee expense likely many expensive time consume dispute will arise
certainty taxation cite main reason adoption new article severely undermine lacuna definition technical service fee
will new article appear
insert new article text un mtc change exist treaty
country want incorporate new article new treaty renegotiate exist treaty incorporate face tough negotiation service export treaty partner
treaty partner likely want concession return least insist reciprocity matter wht service
article could backfire develop country service sector general grow time might become net service exporter
case develop country service exporter would hit wht payment receive treaty partner country treaty contain new article
deem services pe
principle reason profit service perform another state taxable state
however absence fixed place business dependent agent profit service could remain taxable state enterprise tax resident
give increase importance service sector deny host state opportunity tax substantial amount profit make within territory foreign enterprise provision service fixed place business or dependent agent inconsistent general approach take oecd towards division tax revenue state
good reason extend concept pe provision service
oecd commentary point out para commentary article would independent means verify amount revenue earn service pe customer principally retail prepare account could crosscheck pe rather business customer
enterprise send personnel another state might know outset exactly long would stay thus time limit service pe might inadvertently breach lead retrospective recognition service pe record keep
even service pe anticipate start overseas assignment keep appropriate book record attribute share enterprise profit activity personnel post overseas inherently difficult task
oecd mtc develop trade service develop scale see today
hence provision mtc design cope trade goods rather trade service
certain type service subject specific provision transport service service entertainer sport person treaty force present independent personal service person engage professional activity
un mtc always include deem service pe
oecd mtc mention service article permanent establishment although since commentary include wording could use allow provision service treat pe
following section examine first happen mention service article go consider service pe text un mtc optional wording service pe commentary oecd mtc
article apply service
service explicitly mention article whether pe arise provision service depend interpretation article
discuss chapter para fixed place disposal fsp sufficiently long period time will pe
thus instance premise client disposal fsp fsp could pe virtue use client premise
oecd interpretation whether pe arise relation fsp case explicit provision service article contentious
example give commentary particularly para commentary article suggest fsp carry out core function business client premise long enough pe arise
example read
fourth example painter two year spend three day week large office building main client
case presence painter office building perform important function business
painting constitute permanent establishment painter

example contentious could argue although paint office core function business constitution carry business
painter issue invoice advertise service pursue possible new contract etc painter would much business
although painter may carry out core business function client premise painter however say carry business
course possible painter sufficiently sophisticated smartphone painter could possibly
another argument sometimes make client premise merely object business painter something rather carry business within
similar issue arise case dudney see chapter para

term professional service include especially independent scientific literary artistic educational teaching activity well independent activity physician lawyer engineer architect dentist accountant

provision omission para use appear oecd mtc well delete grounds cover type profit deal articles therefore duplicate whilst cause confusion
originally think distinction need industrial commercial profit article net income professional person article
however additional un mtc article provide lack service pe text oecd mtc un mtc retain article
thus state automatically tax individual worldwide basis grounds become tax resident presence tax year article enable state tax profit independent personal service supply individual resident
version commentary un mtc offer wording provision article include article state wish separate article independent personal service wish retain
many treaty existence include general service provision article include article
future negotiation develop state negotiate tax treaty use un mtc will good chance tax least income service provide resident treaty partner state even treaty partner will agree service pe provision article un mtc retain article develop state may able put forward strong case article include new treaty provision subsume article un mtc

different state interpret article differently
kind argument contribute oecd decision scrap article
first test apply article whether fixed base state

addition country strong dependency domestic tax law treaty practice service pe accept observer status committee on fiscal affairs within oecd deal tax treaty matter

two test set out article sometimes know key worker large project test
besides test limit right source state assert existence pe basic principle embody provision
source state assert tax right service must perform state enough enterprise happen deem service pe state
location customer irrelevant even customer state wish assert existence service pe state service perform within jurisdiction

deem pe exist source state permit tax profit arise article hence net basis
thus final withholding tax payment service will permit treaty state include service pe provision
withholding tax use must refundable extent exceed tax due article principle
failure refund would give fsp right invoke
two test broadly equate provision source state taxation enterprise service contain un mtc
pe arise due key worker individual concerned may regard liable taxation employment income source state employment article relevant treaty present
employer would tax net profit service contract customer
arrive net profit salary pay key worker would deductible would double taxation source state
compliance administration issue expect arise
author consider track number day employee spend state will problematic although era computerized timesheet ought
main issue will monitor day spend state requisite appear fairly straightforward add software process employee timesheet
admittedly will onerous small enterprise self employ individual
firm employee gross revenue attributable active business
send employee state perform service series unconnected project last total invoice value
firm employee gross revenue attributable active business
send employee state perform service series unconnected project last total invoice value
firm deem service pe key whilst firm
neither firm deem service pe large project connect
paragraph commentary reveal oecd expect key apply primarily enterprise carry on single individual
test provide measure consistency treatment individual business account individual employee subject provision article para
nevertheless theoretical lack equity demonstrate example may assume great importance practical experience new provision build up
requirement compute amount enterprise gross active business revenue period individual provide service contract state
assume oecd prove correct belief key worker test will apply mainly sole proprietor requirement may place heavy accounting burden small enterprise unlikely account draw up precisely period spend abroad provide service
arguably accounting burden key worker test heavy large project test large project test accounting requirement identify profit attributable provision service
question concern oecd service pe provision two interesting question arise connection update commentary
wording service pe include commentary mtc
oecd simply adopt try test wording use un mtc since
answer first question seem long standing member oecd particular us strongly oppose inclusion provision mtc
include provision text mtc would provide strong bargaining position develop country service importer treaty negotiation
conclude treaty service pe transfer part tax base developed state service exporter develop state service importer
possible rather unlikely far sighted participant development amendment oecd mtc might realize service pe text mtc might the future work disadvantage move status service importer service exporter part development process capitalize comparative advantage provision labour
pijl believe addition desire leave right taxation profit service mtc state taxpayer residence location service pe provision commentary reflect oecd view pe threshold reach limit
pijl also see inclusion service pe oecd commentary response deletion article independent personal services
states particularly wish provision treaty independent personal service might absence provision oecd mtc insist use un mtc retain provision albeit alternative formulation also award great taxing right source state respect royalty income
un provision optional provision put forward oecd require interpretation mean connected contract
mtc tax conventions use concept many year context construction pes relatively little debate context service pe
commentary respect deem service provision refer back general material topic paras
paragraph principle connect project must constitute coherent whole commercially geographically articulate
respect service pe oecd commentary note term connect project refer commercial coherence although decision will rest fact circumstance individual case follow factor will normally relevant
whether project cover single master contract project cover different contract whether conclude person related person whether conclusion additional contract would reasonably expect conclude first contract
whether nature work involve different project whether individual perform service different project

example
technical explanation contain provision similar oecd service pe give example technology consultant contract install particular computer system client also provide training client personnel different computer system
would geographic coherence commercial coherence although conclusion might influence closely two computer system question connect
instance consultant could retain install new suite payroll software
follow immediately could require train client personnel use software
likely would view connected
hand training use software control machine use manufacture would likely two separate project
oecd commentary para
assume state decide must decide basis
will tax profit service perform within border will tax basis eg profit service sell resident use resident
technical term need ask source rule
place performance service oecd firmly believe fsp tax profit service provide host state
paragraph commentary set out member state agree state source taxation right income service perform outside state
income service render outside state service render state resident consider analogous income sale resident state supplier
concept economic allegiance upon source principle found require fact resident customer order permit taxation income

place performance test whether profit service taxable particular state merit easily prove
simple question fact whether person present customer state particular date
however rather crude test source profit service
quite possible fsp resident state could travel state say one month
month could provide service resident state
order provide service might rely heavily back colleague still present state database locate firm office state
high proportion value service provide could say come state
state tax service income net profit basis much problem compute profit attributable service deduction could make cost input state locate staff facility
state charge simple withholding tax gross amount charge service deduction could make could argue place performance wholly satisfactory means allocate right tax
however note india seek tax income service basis utilization service india circumstance service render india
location service utilize state eg india tax fsp profit service provide utilize india regardless service perform location person pay
thus uk fsp perform consultancy service china behalf indian firm would technically liable tax india
however indian government would find tax virtually impossible enforce first know arrangement
second payment make india little physically collect tax
however payment make india eg indian firm indian government subject rule contain collect tax impose withholding tax payment make uk fsp
tax service accord utilize normally mean customer deduct withhold tax payment fsp
sometimes know base erosion approach
indian customer pay uk fsp will claim tax deduction against indian taxable profit reduce tax revenue pay indian government
cause tax base upon india charge tax taxable profit indian firm reduce erode
impose withholding tax uk fsp compensate indian government tax reduction enjoy indian customer negate base erosion
base erosion approach place payment
approach simple administer resident pay nonresident fsp customer state reserve right tax fsp
location customer generally relatively easy determine although special rule may need customer pe country involve purchase service
use place payment basis taxation ie source rule give symmetry tax treatment payment service payer grant tax deduction whilst recipient tax
way customer country tax base protect base erosion would occur tax deduction grant payer without right tax foreign recipient
since fsp might physical type presence customer country practical way enforce tax fsp oblige customer withhold tax payment
building site construction installation project constitute permanent establishment last more than twelve month
un mtc include definition permanent establishment
building site construction assembly installation project supervisory activity connection therewith site project activity last more than six month
installation or assembly project consist largely provision service
construction project will usually consist contract supply bundle goods service
typical contract might supply building would consist supply building material labour design build
category contract know turnkey contract
contract supply commercial facility instance manufacturing or processing plant complete machinery fitment customer need commence operation facility turn key open building start use
project often difficult identify component part less comprehensive contract
difficulty arise host state levy withholding tax technical service fee consider part contract price account service
oecd mtc provide building site construction installation project will constitute pe last
project normally contain high proportion service provision
rationale distinct time period require construction pe compare general guidance require general fixed place make explicit
oecd position seem construction pe exception rule govern fixed place business pe come existence specific time period breach
un position seem deem provision pe arise connection construction activity whether fixed place business time threshold breach
discussion commentary oecd mtc also adopt purpose un mtc article para temporal requirement fixed place business pe para suggest regard fix place business disposal enterprise six month
time period derive review practice oecd member assert existence pe
part commentary means prescriptive period time require attain degree permanence necessary give rise taxable presence
commentary un mtc construction pe discuss minimum time period adopt six month un mtc consistent un service pe time period
un commentary state
idea behind time limit business enterprise one contract state encourage initiate preparatory ancillary operation contract state without become immediately subject tax latter state facilitate permanent large commitment later stage

possible multinational group split up construction contract several wholly subsidiary none breach time limit
oecd final report beps action prevent treaty abuse identify practice abuse treaty concern
two country concern incorporate tax treaty general rule call principal purpose test discuss chapter customer country within right tax net profit subsidiary amongst contract split even though none breach time limit would bring pe existence
unlike un mtc oecd mtc include supervisory service definition construction pe text mtc
however commentary para indicate state may wish include specifically although accord commentary cover para anyway
point definitely cover construction pe provision rather general fixed place
thus subcontractor supply supervisory service construction installation site would need fixed place business pe would need present contract state minimum specified period
question define building site construction installation project pe must define pe first principle partially address para
bring renovation definition provide must involve mere maintenance redecoration
clarification offer report para state project whole must consider context construction installation
thus construct say oil platform different location within state install one location within state would constitute single project within state
possible pe arise enterprise physical presence state construction installation take place
main contractor might subcontract whole project another enterprise employee site presence
paragraph commentary state period spend subcontractor work building site must consider time spend main contractor project
thus project exist beyond time threshold stipulate treaty main contractor enterprise could find liable taxation source principle net profit arise contract
article recommend commentary make clear enterprise subcontract entire construction or installation project would construction pe way construction service supply staff
hence would possible enterprise construction pe without staff physically present host state provide activity subcontractor pe arise accord usual test fixed place business minimum time period
subcontractor firm resident outside state construction site locate subcontractor firm could also pe construction site state
main contractor would taxable source principle profit make construction site deduction expense would include amount pay subcontractor
subcontractor firm would taxable source principle amount receive main contractor less deductible expense
whether construction project connect amalgamated purpose see time limit breach examine para
principle connected project apply construction pe service pe
un mtc include special pe provision respect insurance activity

notwithstanding precede provision article insurance enterprise contract state shall except regard deem permanent establishment contract state collect premium territory state or insure risk situate therein person agent independent status paragraph apply

reason inclusion provision ease nonresident insurance company establish considerable client base source state activity person represent foreign insurer
un mtc commentary article record think could lead difficulty distinguish dependent independent agent
whilst oecd mtc contain specific provision insurance service para commentary acknowledge potential problem insurance business conceivable company large scale business state without tax state profit arise business para
commentary go on suggest provision along line un mtc could adopt depend factual legal situation prevail contract states
reasoning express commentary un mtc point prove prescient light major case later arise concern provision insurance us insurance enterprise canadian customer

one case although court reject suggestion absence specific provision insurance business along line un mtc mean us canada must content fact large scale insurance business could conduct state without pe arise judge state way one state tax profit insurance business conduct state enterprise state via independent agent treaty amend accordingly


distinction royalty technical service fee important many treaty royalty payment may subject withhold tax gross amount
service include definition royalty payment service may attract withholding tax royalty
important note state charge withholding tax specify dtt domestic tax law also allow
instance uk enter number tax treaty permit withhold tax gross amount service fee would charge withholding tax provision uk domestic law
however treaty partner state probably provision domestic law
general principle remember dtt improve position taxpayer make bad
although recent version oecd mtc permit withholding tax royalty many treaty existence
un mtc also still permit withholding tax royalty
article oecd mtc treaty define royalty mean payment kind receive consideration use right use copyright literary artistic scientific work include cinematograph film patent trade mark design model plan secret formula process information concern industrial commercial scientific experience
last two leg definition patent
give rise boundary issue delineation payment royalty payment respect service
paragraph commentary article explain order payment class royalty intellectual property question must exist prior making available design model etc imparting
payment respect development amendment model plan secret formula process work will result gain information concern industrial commercial scientific experience will difficulty assert payment constitute royalty
even developer contract retain right intellectual property develop
analysis present commentary act development constitute service
know present particular problem constitute intellectual property formally recognize say patent or trade mark relatively amorphous asset
commentary make clear article apply making available prior knowledge rather development new knowledge
practice divide line may clear cut example illustrate possible scenario
enterprise send operative expert application certain piece software assist provide training client reasonable expect operative store knowledge might increase client visit
instance enterprise might develop software use overground railway sector might send operative assist client use integrate transport system
technically payment respect operative service ought apportion relate imparting knowledge already possess gain result advise client slightly different business
agreement enterprise client knowledge impart operative remain unrevealed public
confidentiality clause would strengthen case payment regard quite possible client state would take view
enterprise provide expertise face tax uncertainty
distinction contract use contract provision service often rest carry out work
contract client usually carry out work use secret information impart
service contract fsp carry out work client
however distinction ignore situation know provider client work together apply formula implement industrial process
paragraph commentary article offer criterion use distinguish service know contract

know supply must information already exist will exist follow development
commentary explicitly state payment respect development information know
case class must specific provision confidentiality information supply

contract service rather know supplier perform service use special knowledge skill expertise transfer knowledge skill expertise client
degree involvement contact client may indicative type contract contract making available knowhow would consist merely supply exist information necessitate little expenditure supplier order fulfil contract
supply service hand would require much great level expenditure supplier instance wages payment value time research design testing
although criterion helpful reflect reality knowhow likely adapt need client many contract mix term supply service
example mixed contract consider commentary franchising advice offer split contract treat part consideration payment part payment service
ancillary subsidiary supply analysis use case payment mainly one type supply
commentary give example payment consider make service
consideration sale service render seller purchaser warranty pure technical assistance
list potential customer develop specifically payer generally available information list develop confidential information would constitute payment opinion give engineer advocate accountant advice provide electronically electronic communication technician access computer network troubleshooting database database provide user software information response frequently ask question common problem arise frequently
confidentiality recur theme characterize payment
perhaps good characterization know must capable sell multiple customer similar form
even position unclear
would sell multiple client swear secrecy minimal tailor need client count information concern commercial experience
objective criterion make distinction payment use payment service know exist anything pass on client ie already exist
however think india important state agree criterion believe know create provision service
source state levy withholding tax payment consider make use intellectual property double tax relief credit will available recipient tax authority also believe payment make respect use intellectual property
dtt two state will contain definition intellectual property detail
example domestic law state may consider know include particular type expert service supply ltd resident state ltd resident state
dtt state state authorize withholding tax per cent royalty
problem come state examine receipt determine domestic law state payment ltd make respect use intellectual property therefore cover royalty article dtt
circumstance might well refuse give double tax relief withholding tax
well importance distinction payment intellectual property payment service withhold tax purpose distinction also important transfer pricing purpose see chapter
arrive price unconnected party would prepare pay appropriate method payment service would usually cost plus profit margin
contrast appropriate method relation payment use intellectual property ie royalty would usually method base extent use intellectual property call turnover method
practice transfer pricing issue often concern withholding tax issue
relevant dtt contain service pe income profit arise respect service pe deal business profit article ie host state tax net profit service activity
treaty contain service pe provision payment service vulnerable withhold tax gross amount
however even deem service pe provision relevant dtt state domestic law permit withhold tax gross basis payment service fee still risk withholding tax will apply
starting point business profit article host state may tax business profit enterprise resident state extent arise pe locate host state
two set circumstance deem service pe will necessarily result taxation service fee net basis host state
first paragraph article oecd mtc state profit include item income deal separately article provision article take precedence article
hence provision taxation service fee gross basis say within royalty article service fee will deal royalty article may well allow withhold tax gross basis
second even absence specific provision tax treatment service fee elsewhere treaty business profit article contain definition business profit treaty open host state assert service fee business profit

fee business profit rule article apply rule relevant article will apply
article deal specifically service fee circumstance would fall residual
oecd mtc income may tax state beneficial owner resident un mtc modify income arise one contract states may tax state
position historically take brazil whose treaty base un mtc justification levy withholding tax per cent outbound payment service

brazilian treatment significant brazil key market international fsp rather unusual brazil recently afford treaty law equal status domestic law also domestic law consider technical service fee constitute business profit
oecd mtc contain definition business profit commentary article para state although find necessary convention define term profit nevertheless understand term use article elsewhere convention broad meaning include income derive carry enterprise
chapter
start study topic vital recognize enterprise business operation one country may make profit pay tax one country
owner enterprise assume shareholder mainly concern tax total global profit enterprise
tax authority country enterprise operate will concern tax profit attributable branch subsidiary enterprise country
know entity principle
entity principle provide opportunity tax planning within multinational enterprise mne usually take form group company possibly also type entity partnership
crude term mne will wish maximize global profit whilst minimize global tax liability although obviously consideration come play long term structural robustness legal regulatory requirement
tax planning may entail simply make use beneficial tax rule example concession make available many country attract investment
another way achieve aim plan mne profit tax purpose attribute wherever possible within bound relevant legislation lower tax country
yet another way achieve aim exploit difference tax system country enterprise operate
know tax arbitrage
company wish expand overseas must decide whether want set up separate subsidiary whether foreign operation will branch exist company
choice effect tax treatment business profit loss overseas operation home country new country
branch generally treat integral part head office entity treat separate taxpayer home country
mean country head office entity locate will seek tax branch profit part entity profit operate worldwide approach international tax
subsidiary hand usually treat separate legal taxpaying entity country residence parent company generally right tax profit subsidiary directly tax dividend payment make subsidiary parent
one important consideration loss
branch make loss will generally account head office entity purpose tax head office country residence
subsidiary make loss usually utilise parent company although country choose allow
choice branch subsidiary also important finance perspective
subsidiary branch choice financing equity share capital debt loan discuss chapter
key issue decide structure new foreign venture whether set it up branch parent company separate subsidiary
mean choice foreign venture structure partnership joint venture various type well
simplicity will use term parent subsidiary denote two entity separate legal status one subsidiary parent
will use term head office branch denote two entity different jurisdiction formally separate one another example company one country permanent establishment branch another
choice vehicle often influence variety rule find different country type legal entity recognize tax purpose consider transparent
instance partnership arrangement consider transparent effect will foreign government will tax partner usually two company separate pe
alternative transparent opaque
tax authority consider partnership joint venture taxable entity right ie opaque will levy tax partnership joint venture rather individual partner
besides choice various type partnership arrangement firm operate within eu may opt eu corporate vehicle societas europaea see chapter
however purpose chapter discussion will limit choice branch structure subsidiary company structure
see chapter branch pe generally confer tax right country branch locate accord source principle
branch fact least controversial type pe since universally accept physical presence sufficient attract tax company set up branch will usually clear understanding profit branch will fall tax country location
significant thing note branch generally separate legal entity remain part head office company establish
important consequence tax purpose
country residence company establish branch operate worldwide system therefore tax profit company wherever earn profit branch will fall tax part company overall taxable income country residence
tax charge would arise basis residence country head office would wait profit transfer one country another
situation will usual country residence allow credit tax pay host country respect branch profit
hand head office residence country operate territorial system foreign income generally exempt might also apply branch profit
instance uk extend exemption corporation tax foreign income encompass income foreign branch well dividend receive foreign subsidiary
branch exemption optional see para
must also consider loss deal context branch
give branch usually consider part entity head office branch make loss relief will give loss immediately course aggregate company income profit purpose worldwide residence taxation
often consider key advantage set up foreign operation way branch
addition change legal ownership transfer asset branch will generally attract capital tax either home host jurisdiction
remittance profit branch head office company will often also attract tax country source branch separate entity
country however make special charge remittance branch profit grounds subsidiary company use instead would charge withholding tax remittance company profit shareholder make form dividend
many country either prohibition use branch foreign corporation else branch enjoy full range investment incentive offer subsidiary company
think would suit invest company good tax viewpoint vital check allow foreign country
may transpire host country will grant incentive subsidiary rather branch
purpose require foreign company invest form subsidiary rather branch usually taxing right host country clear also case provide minimum level local participation shareholding
indeed country permit joint venture arrangement ensure share fully wealth create
example india automatically permit use branch manufacture activity insist instead foreign company subcontract work indian resident company
india also place restriction percentage ownership subsidiary foreign company
limit vary industry industry plethora rule negotiate
structuring use foreign subsidiary
establish separate legal entity form subsidiary company may necessary order access tax incentive offer host country one consequence loss will probably available offset against profit parent company tax purpose
will often trap within subsidiary although host country may well provide mechanism relieve loss eg carry forward later period
subsidiary profitable will subject tax host country country residence subsidiary general rule profit will subject tax hand parent company time remit either dividend form payment interest
parent company subsidiary separate legal entity tax purpose
deferral parent company tax foreign profit provide advantage compare branch operation subsidiary locate jurisdiction low tax rate parent company represent tax saving worldwide group company
deferral advantage lead adoption control foreign company rule see chapter
many country include uk exempt dividend receive hold company subsidiary although us instead grant double tax relief credit method
however interest royalty receive hold company subsidiary usually taxable hand hold company subject double tax relief credit
parent company country determine company tax residence accord central management control similar rule important foreign subsidiary incorporate abroad also manage control abroad
otherwise may fully taxable parent company country
advantage use foreign subsidiary rather branch many country grant exemption tax capital gain make parent company gain sale share subsidiary company
uk example would grant substantial shareholding relief subject usual condition attach relief

example demonstrate difference branch subsidiary parent company locate country operate credit system double tax relief
example assume parent company country unitia permit offset foreign branch loss against profit invest company
growco ltd retailer garden furniture
currently operate solely unitia consider open shop country inistania
prepare budget follow the first few year inistanian operation
unitian operation growco ltd expect produce taxable profit per annum the next five year
effective rate corporation tax inistania per cent withholding tax payment dividend interest overseas resident
effective rate unitian corporation tax face growco ltd per cent
unitia operate credit system double tax relief give relief underlie tax well withhold tax
subsidiary choose dividend per cent available profit will pay growco ltd each year
inistanian government permit carry forward loss subsidiary branch
example global tax liability less year year branch great year year
subsidiary use reverse true
growco ltd could good world start branch convert subsidiary the end of year
dividend pay would tax liability unitia subsidiary profit
calculation depend way unitia deal foreign branch profit loss
example assume unitia give relief foreign branch loss tax foreign branch profit
however many country rule seek treat profit loss foreign branch way profit loss foreign subsidiary
country include uk rule effect grant loss relief foreign branch loss tax foreign branch profit
thus tax system neutral treatment foreign operation however structure
complication arise country permit relief branch loss parent company country operate system double tax relief exemption
possible inistania may permit loss carry forward set against future branch profit
instead credit method unitia operate system double tax relief exemption branch loss may offset against head office unitian profit the early year against inistanian profit branch become profitable year
happen unitia may wish provision dtt inistania effect branch profit will exempt extent branch loss reduce unitian taxable profit previous year call loss recapture rule
also assume inistania levy branch profit tax
country charge withholding tax branch profit remit head office country thus treat profit repatriation way whether way branch profit dividend
uk rule taxation foreign branch profit loss examine chapter
taxation chargeable gain act tcga sch
convert branch subsidiary
see operate foreign business branch often mean immediate relief loss will usually available business operate subsidiary
expectation loss will incur example the initial year new business operation may make sense establish branch first instance view convert subsidiary become profitable
consequence conversion will depend specific rule country branch locate may attract capital gain tax effectively involve sale business new legal entity
may also restriction capacity transfer branch loss carry forward new subsidiary
recent year see growth number inversion us uk

overall aim divert foreign income away current hold company location low tax location

section consider position group company borrowing interest payable
company resident country operate double taxation credit method company various source type foreign income
aim company maximize usage foreign tax credit
country rule double tax relief system limit foreign tax credit amount residence country tax income
interest payment set against foreign income reduce residence country tax foreign income thus restrict amount foreign tax offset
instance us insist lender must offset interest payable against category income pro rata relative value taxpayer asset thus bulk company asset share foreign subsidiary bulk interest payment must set against dividend income subsidiary
effect restrict scope offset foreign withholding tax relate dividend interest receive subsidiary
foreign tax credit attach receipt interest will withhold tax whereas foreign tax credit relate dividend may consist withholding tax underlie corporation tax another reason debt financing might prefer might insufficient scope utilise full double tax credit produce receipt foreign dividend
also debt finance oppose equity finance will lower value shareholding foreign subsidiary thus reduce allocation interest payable us company must set against income subsidiary
rule require interest pay offset against income class proportion amount underlie asset ruritanian corporation tax allocate foreign dividend severely restrict turn restrict amount double tax credit foreign dividend offset
without rule govern offset interest payment company could allocate another interest against trading income
would leave interest offset against foreign dividend ruritanian corporation tax applicable dividend hence maximum offset foreign tax credit would rise
interest offset rule restrict offset foreign tax credit dividend
even country interest allocation rule may tax efficient separate finance company borrow externally behalf mne
thus interest deduction will claim company whereas dividend foreign subsidiary will receive different company great capacity utilize available tax credit fully would interest payment allocate against income

recommend change oecd mtc adopt country treaty recommendation design ensure entity treat tax resident ie opaque tax treaty purpose one partner treaty treat transparent therefore disregard partner treaty

well establish principle international taxation company group must apply open market pricing equivalent transaction
know arm length principle
pricing transaction usually refer transfer pricing
chapter look principle detail one aspect rule thin capitalization directly concern financing arrangement mne deal chapter
transfer pricing principle apply financial transaction way transaction involve goods service
rate interest charge intragroup must comparable take account term intragroup loan rate charge lender borrower outside mne
discount commission fee must also compute use arm length principle
thin capitalization concern rate interest charge amount fund lend group company fellow group company relative amount equity share capital borrower
company say thinly capitalized ratio equity capital debt capital low would expect company independent enterprise rather member group company
temptation mne finance subsidiary high tax jurisdiction high ratio debt equity
thus return debt capital mainly tax deductible interest rather dividend
although dividend low risk payment dividend optional profit pay company pay dividend ever repay capital sum invest share
high level debt capital create high level risk borrower interest must pay each year capital repay debt mature regardless whether borrower cash profit
company pay interest repay debt fund lend unconnected bank bank would position put company business seize asset
however group company lend fellow group company would unlikely follow harsh course action
arrangement mne lender mne borrower company investment make high level debt capital relative equity capital arrangement would expect open market borrower experience level risk large amount debt relative share equity capital
thin capitalization legislation reclassify part interest deduction dividend recognize least part debt capital effect permanent capital
grounds much debt capital company borrow could never hope repay remain business
permanent capital return equity capital dividend distribution profit interest
application substance form principle
two subsidiary identical profit interest tax dividend
due difference financing structure taxable profit birch ltd much low
uk tax authority would unlikely challenge capital structure alder ltd give debt equity ratio
may challenge regard interest payment
tax authority successful part interest payment might reclassify dividend mean would longer reduce profit chargeable corporation tax
every country thin capitalization rule version
fairly general whilst extremely prescriptive
might expect us rule extremely prescriptive
adjustment will make us pay company taxable profit us thin capitalization legislation provide interest amount less corporation tax adjust income provide ratio debt equity less
specification acceptable gearing ratio example safe harbour
ratio commonly use context country although country employ safe harbour concept
italy introduce new thin capitalization rule first time
legislation affect interest payment shareholder directly indirectly least share capital italian company whose debt equity ratio great
thin capitalization rule interest pay third party loan guarantee group company also catch
limit deduction predicate belief mne commonly arrange external internal borrowing artificially inflate tax deduction claim mne company interest payable
whilst might well true case mention early group financing policy will many driver tax usually one
oecd correct belief mne routinely arrange group financing artificially inflate tax deduction interest claimable mne whole
certainly mne highly centralized finance function would surprising factor decision whether extent finance group member debt capital whether mne member borrowing externally making intragroup loan
valid argument come financing decision mne whole important
separate entity fiction deem separate legal person mne separate economic entity difficult justify arena group financing decision
many country already rule domestic law tackle one issue eg note time write uk worldwide debt cap tackle first common many country thin capitalization rule tackle second
many country also rule limit deduction interest specific percentage profit
notably country presently rule impose limitation interest pay base position worldwide group
many country rule limit interest deduction amongst international coordination rule
technique arm length principle discuss chapter
word interest deduction claim company member mne line interest deduction would claim similar company similar circumstance except part group
however oecd consider approach resource intensive time consume practical use taxpayer tax authority

word oecd consider arm length approach simply difficult use decide whether interest deduction within group company justified
give huge resource oecd continue pour develop update arm length principle decision abandon means determine whether interest deduction claim acceptable amount seem surprising
many commentator instance international chamber of commerce icc react dismay abandonment arm length principle
publish consider three broad approach limit interest deduction call worldwide approach fix approach involve target rule
combination approach also consider
final report action advocate fix approach explain section
public comment receive action run page overall seem little appetite worldwide approach
widespread belief apparent public comment approach would draconian
worldwide approach
worldwide approach two main part
find out much interest worldwide group company pay external borrower period question
result figure reduce amount interest receivable third party period
allocate part net interest expense company worldwide group
amount company allocate would depend level economic activity carry out company relative total economic activity whole group
choice allocate portion worldwide group total third individual group company base upon either
earnings mne company relative earnings mne whole
value asset mne company relative total asset worldwide group
overriding criterion allocation interest deduction reflect location value creation within mne
mne company create value need funding pay wages buy new machinery and intellectual property carry out
therefore company would naturally expect borrowing would need pay interest
hand relatively inactive group company would probably need much funding would relatively expense
profitability probably good measure contribution value create group company
however profit fluctuate year year abnormal cost cost purchase new premise mask true profitability group member
one key requirement system allocation interest deduction within group company result predictable
base allocation profit earnings might predictable oecd recommend allocation undertake basis net asset value instead
note total interest deduction mne limit amount external borrowing
illustration show interest allocation rule might work
example disregard actual interest pay company substitute deem interest expense
alternative method still use worldwide approach would interest cap
instance use net earnings key instead company interest deduction deem company could claim deduction interest actually payable internal external mne cap
however actual interest payment would interest deduction claimable
however use cap would mean mne would obtain interest relief total rather total external interest pay
many commentator criticize oecd proposal action
biac raise concern mne will encourage take on unnecessary level external debt
general observation ratio debt equity choose group component member company product internal external pressure means drive tax concern
refer early split debt equity influence issue minority interest exist creditor exchange control local regulatory constraint well foreign exchange issue biac public comment action
fundamental criticism worldwide approach essence formulary apportionment mne interest expense

formulary apportionment reject action continue reject beps action area transfer pricing
idea formulary apportionment discuss detail chapter
major criticism formulary apportionment work country mne operate apply system particular formula
overall principal criticism worldwide approach practical one would involve heavy compliance cost every group company claim interest deduction would need know position entire group could establish amount interest deduction company entitle
cost would significant even exemption grant small company within mne
fix ratio approach approach recommend oecd interest deduction
approach allowable deduction interest group company would limit percentage company earnings
way erosion tax base interest deduction would limit
limitation need specifically reference earnings could make reference asset equity
many country already apply version rule call thin capitalization rule discuss early chapter
thin capitalization rule interest deduction limit interest proposition debt equity within claimant company might expect claimant company independent company part group
although strictly speak use arm length approach many country publish ratio debt equity commonly will seek apply rule
fix ratio approach would much simple apply comply worldwide approach
rely solely tax position single entity mne company make reference debt level elsewhere mne
requirement international cooperation far low country could fix ratio
ebitda recommend base value determine tax rule country apply rule basis use tax number reduce risk entity negative ebitda become liable tax result interest disallowance also link interest deduction taxable earnings make difficult group increase limit deduction without also increase level taxable income country
apply fix ratio approach reference ebitda example show example
advantage fix ratio approach group wide approach
consistency separate entity approach tax member international group company individual company need know figure interest ratio limit apply country need extra information position
flexibility country set ratio reflect local economic climate take account measure particular country already place rule cfc rule
country also use definition interest accordance local law
compliance administration cost would much low worldwide regime
country simplify application rule eg de minimis threshold company entity relatively small interest payment would catch
effect disallowance interest ameliorate permit carry forward disallow amount interest also excess capacity offset interest future year
situation relatively group company position secure external borrowing disallowance interest may occur company unable push the debt down operating subsidiary via onlend
instance example see although company external interest payable would unable obtain tax deduction
limit would broadly agree oecd member per cent ebitda appear limit commonly use oecd consider high
company would know maximum permit interest deduction period know ebitda period
would make difficult company accurately budget cost debt finance
tax deductible interest low net cost company interest
problem could lessen company permit carry forward back excess interest capacity
would need mechanism ensure intragroup interest deduction disallow tax hand mne lend company
subsidiary company tax resident different country investor country investor tax resident country subsidiary tax resident may tax invest company dividend interest
country subsidiary tax resident usually tax dividend interest means withholding tax

article oecd model tax convention deal interest payment permit withhold tax charge
dtt exist country payer recipient interest common payer country require rate standard rate income tax domestic law often rate well excess rate specify treaty
would answer differ uk lender pension fund uk tax exempt
will assume amount interest pay ghanaian borrower withhold tax ie
ghana would limit withholding tax per cent pension fund would subject uk tax interest receive
however note interpretation subject tax clause vary country country interpret mean ghana would consider tax exempt organization subject tax uk
note unusual withhold tax result double taxation
rate withhold tax normally low tax rate face invest company country residence
depend double tax relief system use investor country interest dividend will either exempt else withholding tax will creditable against tax liability country residence
however recipient company low nonexistent domestic tax liability interest income say due offset domestic loss withholding tax may become absolute tax liability increase total worldwide tax bill rather merely redistribute
big disadvantage suffer withholding tax time payment tax effectively bring forward time interest pay rather recipient tax liability fall due country residence
usually cash flow disadvantage
country will give double tax credit withhold tax believe correctly charge payer country
problem sometimes arise one country class payment royalty charge withhold tax recipient country classify payment technical service

transfer pricing practice basics
simply mean pricing business transaction associated person
notice definition mention taxation
discuss transfer pricing international tax context however term use represent artificial manipulation internal transfer price within multinational group intention create tax advantage
tax purpose transfer pricing become challenge need establish amount taxable profit taxable entity
will usually single company country tax group company single entity
also important compute much profit attributable part company locate another tax jurisdiction ie pe
transfer pricing legislation provide key tool government protect corporate tax base
prevent artificial shifting profit within multinational group company country provide low effective tax rate mne must able demonstrate intragroup price arm length
mean price would charge similar circumstance similar transaction two unrelated party
mne demonstrate use arm length pricing tax authority may adjust profit upwards would arm length pricing use
depend tax treaty relation two party transaction may may reciprocal adjustment tax charge country concerned
arm find article oecd model double tax convention method recommend oecd influential transfer pricing guideline for multinational enterprise tax administration
also form basis us rule tend far detailed
two strand ascertain arm one approve method accompany functional analysis multinational group regards risk asset allocation head office function assume factor apparent first glance
approve method generally consider individual transaction oppose global split combine profit multinational group
fundamental difference dealings group company independent party price charge also type transaction enter into extremely difficult arrive arm length price
oecd beps action particularly problematic aspect application arm length pricing rule
conceptually arm length principle open much criticism due fact transaction member multinational group bind nature considerably different unconnected party
commentator consider global profit multinational group would good split relevant tax authority use agree formula rather try impose arm length principle
although body thought transfer price heavily influence tax increase sophistication multinational group potential reduction global tax liability manipulation transfer pricing police mean tax likely important driver setting intragroup price
two basic possibility allocate taxable profit individual entity within mne

top take profit whole group divide individual entity unitary taxation
bottom look entity separately calculate profit independent entity separate entity
separate currently global norm tax mne
separate entity principle allow country determine entity within mne eg subsidiary pe entitle tax usually reference residence source principle see chapter
identify entity chargeable tax country next step devise mechanism determine much profit belong entity
transfer pricing rule serve purpose
tax authority will legislation aim protect tax base manipulative transfer pricing practice deem transaction must account tax purpose market value use arm length principle
however establish open market value easy
government anxious ensure profit report member multinational group reflect fair commercial level profit

set
whilst method use pak zdanowicz arrive overall estimate tax lose subject considerable criticism anecdotal evidence certainly attract public attention

interesting analysis misleading statistics use context debate transfer pricing seeforstater
basic problem illustrate
example
multinat plc two trading subsidiary
one tax resident country konganga effective rate corporation tax per cent
company extract export greensand raw material use group production process
open market price greensand per tonne
subsidiary resident country ruritania effective tax rate per cent
ruritanian subsidiary buy raw material bulk konganga subsidiary
quantity purchase each year tonne
multinat plc wish instruct two subsidiary adopt pricing policy optimize tax profit group whole
question consider
price charge konganga tax purpose low high price might charge unrelated customer
government might object pricing policy
set price per tonne produce increase global tax liability whereas set per tonne produce reduction
give combined profit tax whatever transfer price tax position optimize transfer price
government lose tax revenue result policy ruritania

multinat plc control konganga ruritanian subsidiary open ruritanian tax authority argue transfer price per tonne represent difference commercial relation would expect independent enterprise
extra taxable profit would include ruritanian subsidiary account arm length pricing use profit tax minus profit tax
ruritania will levy tax additional profit

inherent problem requirement internal price within company within group company invariably different would charge independent enterprise
even present
government generally recognize problem develop framework adjust actual price take account justifiable difference
irs identify five factor determine comparability factor lead adjustment make actual independent price source adjustment internal transfer price price charge independent enterprise will consider briefly
identify function perform individual company
function carry out different member multinational group must consider contribute towards internal price setting
rationale behind functional analysis important function perform group company high proportion group profit reflect company taxable profit
good functional analysis must therefore
fully understand economics particular business market
aim highlight distinctiveness produce sensitivity demand price
recognize invisible factor evident account
identify relative level risk carry various group company
excellent case study application functional analysis seelenz vogel
accord irs comparison require function perform resource employ party transaction
functional analysis will consider
type scope economically significant transaction undertake
resource party employ connection activity could tangible intangible fixed asset
type value add party could include
research development
product design engineering
manufacturing production process engineering
product fabrication extraction assembly
purchasing and material management
marketing and distribution function include inventory management warranty administration advertising activity
transportation warehousing managerial legal accounting finance credit
transaction comparable contractual term must comparable
rarely case compare intragroup transaction one independent party
common difference identify example
form consideration charge pay transaction normally settle via entry account ie book entry rather entry reflect receipt currency
payment thus immediate lessening risk exchange loss reduce administrative cost bank charge debt collection
sale will often repeat customer purchase bulk
scope term warranty provide purchaser buy fellow group company may require less extensive warranty buy unknown independent supplier
right update revision modification
duration relevant licence contract agreement termination renegotiation right
collateral transaction ongoing business relationship buyer seller include arrangement provision ancillary subsidiary service
high price could well justify seller incur high risk
conversely sell know longstanding group member may well involve low risk deal unconnected company
identify relevant risk
market risk include fluctuation cost demand pricing inventory level
instance say wholly uk subsidiary us washing machine manufacturer contract parent company take delivery washing machine per year three year price per machine
uk company must market washing machine uk provision return unsold stock us supplier
year washing machine sell
year sell
however year marketing strategy adopt uk subsidiary finally begin work remain stock sell
uk subsidiary bear loss contract the first two year without support parent therefore will assist us supplier convince irs transfer price low notwithstanding fact much stock sell uk subsidiary price well excess transfer price
risk associate success failure research and development activity type risk discuss connection transfer pricing pharmaceutical industry
financial risk include fluctuation foreign currency rate exchange interest rate
credit collection risk
product liability risk customer pursue claim goods bear cost meet claim
example discuss would us supplier uk subsidiary recompense customer faulty washing machine
tax authority would look see make payment customer whether intragroup reimbursement
general business risk relate ownership property plant equipment
different profit margin possible different country different time
instance profit margin wartime transaction often much high peacetime due scarcity surge demand cause war
compare transaction type adjustment economic condition could include
similarity geographic market instance similar profit margin achievable eu country whilst quite different profit margin might expect look pair transaction one involve customer china one involve customer canada
relative size market extent overall economic development market
might available market open up say develop country
level market eg wholesale retail etc
relevant market share product property service transfer provide high market share high expected profit margin
location specific cost factor production distribution instance maintain delicate machinery might far costly tropical climate temperate one
link back risk security cost might far high maintain production facility politically unstable country us
extent competition market regard property service review

price may first examination appear well excess arm length price
oecd originally recommend use three method comparable uncontrolled price resale price minus although two additional transaction base method transactional net margin profit split permit last resort eg absence comparable
revise guidelines five method place equal footing state process select take account respective strength weakness
however traditional transaction method transactional profit method apply equally reliable manner traditional transactional method prefer
us regulation require use good method rule
mean firm must consider method outline use one reliable comparable available
distribution company buy fellow group member selling unconnected customer without add significant value good method likely resale price minus
manufacturing company vertically integrate group make sale group member comparable sale unconnected party make cost plus likely good method
good method rule generally mean comply us regulation difficult comply oecd guidelines require calculation single method
important aware transfer pricing far exact science
provide price show within acceptable range price adjustment taxable profit tax authority may avoid
determine acceptable range difficult essentially qualitative matter require skill judgement consider relevant factor
us insist statistical approach value within interquartile range exclude low per cent high per cent result consider acceptable
irs also favour median point appropriate point range comparable
comparable uncontrolled price
rationale behind comparable uncontrolled price compare actual transfer price control intragroup transaction comparable price apply unrelated party ie uncontrolled
main problem method difficulty find exact match term product firm market risk geographic location forth
number government eg canadian know use secret comparable ie disclose get information
controversial practice
accord oecd guidelines factor consider assess comparable two transaction really may state follow
specific characteristic property service question
function enterprise perform specific reference asset use risk undertake
contractual term

particular business strategy relevant transaction eg loss leader
us regulation give similar list see paras

factor take account use transactional method establish arm length price
common adjustment use cup adjustment take account difference sale volume frequency transaction difference contractual term
example establish arm length price use cup black ltd orange plc uk company supply each month fellow subsidiary tax resident iceland white inc price per widget

however icelandic market open up black first supplier
because white inc detail knowledge performance reliability product agree forgo usual product warranty
initial discrepancy pricing appear per widget
make appropriate adjustment difference narrow
adjustment profit either company will make base per widget

method tend appropriate group company company sell on another group company company make sale final unconnected consumer minimum processing otherwise add value goods
use check transfer price viewpoint company company although would likely use verify price pay
method work take price charge company final consumer deduct appropriate gross margin resale price margin
margin must sufficient cover operating and selling expense company leave appropriate net profit
difference price charge company customer appropriate gross margin attribute company price charge company company
cup adjustment may appropriate allow difference characteristic intragroup sale sale unconnected party
crude form industry average gross profit percentage might apply
accurate calculation would examine purchase company independent supplier establish arm length gross profit margin

method apply various profit level indicator broadly speak financial ratio rate return capital operate profit sale well ratio examine relationship profit cost sale revenue
arm length method strenuous effort must make adjust difference company consideration company industry
instance company investigation may particularly skilled workforce advanced form manufacturing process compare competitor firm
cpm popular two main reason
first relatively easy irs apply
under cup detailed transactional datum require probably available taxpayer will use selectively present evidence irs
take many month year gather sufficient evidence use cup method irs inherent disadvantage
however use cpm industry statistical data readily available public domain financial ratio analysis apply
irs thus far less reliant evidence supply directly taxpayer less constrain confidentiality
method lend statistical analysis firm note early irs generally consider result within range ie eliminate consideration top bottom per cent result apply ratio analysis selection firm
second discuss take broad approach method cup suitable use negotiate advance pricing agreement see later chapter
method criticize overtly transactional apply retrospectively profit outcome transaction rather pricing policy govern transaction
however give result broadly speak transactional net margin method method apply series transaction

base fact circumstance irs may determine comparable profit method will provide reliable measure arm length result
ussub select test party engage activity less complex undertake

defence price generic version provide evidence comparable uncontrolled price evidence deal arm length
quality generic ranitidine could assure comparable manufacture glaxo singapore
moreover licence agreement uk parent company glaxo group glaxo canada permit market zantac provide considerable advantage glaxo canada
glaxo canada therefore claim true comparable would company purchase ranitidine similar circumstance ie one party similar licensing agreement glaxo canada uk parent

tax court of canada disagree licence agreement glaxo group take alongside purchasing agreement swiss affiliate two agreement interlink

mean many transaction group member comparable transaction independent enterprise
second necessarily heavy investment research development lead need cost share arrangement detailed functional analysis transfer pricing policy
third heavily regulate government country operate
new drug test manufacture without licence country detailed regulation granting

instance pharmaceutical group merck force withdraw ground break drug vioxx amidst claim patient illness
every successful new drug many abortive programme research development
successful programme may lead creation intangible asset patent new drug
whilst reasonable group member compensate make available benefit intangible asset group member problem pharmaceutical industry much result creation intangible
group member incur unsuccessful venture will recoup expenditure group member either cost share arrangement loading cost successful product unsuccessful venture
support documentation vital protect group attack tax authority transfer pricing policy respect
particularly relevant invoice cost group member margin leave cost include transfer pricing entity bear
practice policy may lead demand withholding tax part purchase price product tax authority could regard part purchase price tantamount payment royalty
tax authority may argue carry out subsidiary country profit attributable company also locate country high actually report virtue fact carry out group
false assumption reward carry out belong company carry it out country whole
another question whether location group particular country give rise pe whether view merely preparatory auxiliary making contract
permanent establishment hold exist issue relate attribution profit establishment will address difficult context
drug patent tend relatively short life heavy marketing expenditure necessary establish brand continue market leader even patent expire
whilst much cheap generic version drug may become available market must persuade continue purchase original brand product
instance uk purchase paracetamol aspirin ibuprofen cheaply indeed buy generic version popular brand retain large market share
imply heavy marketing campaign licensee drug target specific country market
another aspect pharmaceutical industry lead exceptionally heavy marketing expenditure primary market many drug body prescribe practitioner
pharmaceutical company employ highly train drug representative visit doctor practitioner premise carefully explain product
run up immediately expiry patent normally ballooning marketing expenditure firm seek consolidate position product market
thus even requirement pay patent royalty cease exist profitability licensee may deteriorate due need increase marketing expenditure

however nature research and development cost eventual cost benefit work uncertain
us regulation govern cost sharing stipulate actual benefit differ significantly anticipate benefit cost share arrangement must revisit
new regulation effective specify ratio

main disadvantage formulary apportionment firm may manipulate component formula
oecd traditionally object adoption formulary apportionment several grounds apply application system within single country
must common agreement country multinational group operate factor use weighting apply
however inevitably individual country will attempt construct formula advantage individual country
would lead overlap double taxation part global profit group would vulnerable tax multiple location
system would open manipulation multinational group instance key factor production influence profit allocation manufacture facility could shift low tax jurisdiction increase allocation global profit jurisdiction
possible method manipulation could include outsourcing function high tax jurisdiction decrease payroll headcount cost thus global profit allocation jurisdiction
formula properly take account market condition efficiency difference easily account degree risk suffer different entity within multinational group
use different accounting policy different country lead distortion true share profit arise country combine global profit figure
objection may water down adoption international financial reporting standards ifrs prove widespread successful
although ifrs increasingly widespread success open question
even formulary apportionment could prove good system arm length principle hurdle clear
arm length principle accept worldwide standard determine transfer pricing issue
replacement principle must also accept worldwide order become replacement international standard
eu produce revise draft directive implement would see limited system formula apportionment operate group company resident eu member states
know common consolidated corporation tax base ccctb
however plan well receive
member states appear reluctant give up right set rule company tax
even advocate formula apportionment criticize proposal leave intangible formula use apportion group taxable profit
ccctb plan discuss chapter
despite oecd refusal adopt formulary apportionment method approve might view formula apportionment name
particular profit split method depend look function perform risk bear asset use group company profit split
compare approach formula apportionment much difference
profit split accord group company perform key function relation transaction group company bear risk asset make transaction question possible
however global formula apportionment must distinguish unitary taxation
unitary taxation denote system multinational group treat single unitary entity profit allocate via formulary apportionment
profit split method essentially transactional method rather one attempt split entire profit whole group
rather make stark choice arm length principle formulary apportionment method ensure fair split group taxable profit country operate academic suggest system could adopt combine
system transaction suitable comparable would continue judge accord arm length principle
however type transaction occur internally within group suitable comparable limited system formula apportionment could adopt
would base profit split method
advocate allocate multinational taxable group profit country operate use arm length method first
however group profit result internal transaction simply usable comparable transaction suggest apply formulary apportionment split residual group taxable profit country party transaction
idea use standard formula split profit certain type transaction group member
government would adopt standard formula particular type transaction
would need examine say royalty payment transaction transaction basis standard formula could apply
approach would necessarily need country involve agree formula instance royalty pay us subsidiary bermudan subsidiary maximum tax deductible rate royalty could set us
actual royalty might high would small tax deduction us large taxable amount bermuda

contract state include profit enterprise accordingly profit enterprise contract state charge tax state profit include profit would accrue enterprise first mention state condition make two enterprise would make independent enterprise state shall make appropriate adjustment amount tax charge therein profit
determine adjustment due regard shall provision convention competent authority contract states shall necessary consult

double tax treaty deal position regard secondary adjustment
one state make upwards adjustment taxable profit make exactly equal correspond downwards adjustment tax revenue two state might still different would arm length pricing apply first place
high profit state upwards adjustment take place might well give rise high dividend interest payment withholding tax might chargeable
even though state make upwards adjustment retrieve tax deficit enterprise resident still retrieve deficit withholding tax
whether make secondary upwards adjustment make good deficit withhold tax receipt depend whether provide domestic law
double taxation will result will necessarily relieve normal treaty article elimination double taxation may necessary invoke mutual agreement procedure

case must present within three year first notification action result taxation accordance provision convention

use example fact company tax inistania profit also still tax ruritania company mean double taxation profit
accordance provision treaty convention
assume provision similar article oecd model company present case inistanian tax authority require try reach mutual agreement inistanian tax authority represent arm length price therefore reciprocal downwards adjustment inistania properly reflect upwards adjustment make inistania
company three year present case
the three year would normally run date reasonably prudent person would realize subject double taxation
case would probably date become apparent ruritania prepare make downwards adjustment large upwards adjustment require inistania

prove key difference case aiken
taxpayer northern indiana win against us government argue finance merely conduit nipsco view pay interest directly eurobond holder therefore withhold tax interest payment us domestic rate per cent unless relevant tax treaty apply payment nipsco european investor permit low rate
tax court however find finance carry sufficient
however interest may also tax contract state arise accord law state beneficial owner interest resident contract state tax charge shall exceed gross amount interest

practice variation find many old treaty require recipient interest beneficial owner
current wording oecd mtc beneficial owner resident state payment make beneficial owner direct recipient
requirement beneficial ownership commonly use grant preferential treaty rate withhold tax dividend interest royalty sometimes income ie income specifically deal article well
oecd commentary article relatively brief explanation beneficial ownership
explain mere receipt interest resident state sufficient treaty rate withhold tax operate term interpret context light object purpose treaty rather narrow technical sense
thus person receive interest payment capacity nominee agent would beneficial ownership interest domestic rate withhold tax rather treaty rate would apply unless nominee agent obligation pay interest beneficial owner resident state agent
long report use conduit company consider meaning beneficial ownership briefly note conduit company normally regard beneficial owner though formal owner certain asset narrow power render mere fiduciary administrator act account interested party likely shareholder conduit company

beneficial ownership also consider two canadian case prévost velcro
prévost decide despite many indication contrary court decide company receipt dividend beneficial owner
case particularly interesting examine meaning term beneficial ownership several different language attempt fix comparable meaning
also case hear law quebec civil law territory
unlike common law jurisdiction uk concept beneficial ownership well develop area case law say regard trust concept recognize quebec law
fact shareholder canadian bus manufacturer prévost want sell share volvo swedish henlys uk bus manufacturer
dutch company ph bv form canadian shareholder sell share
ph bv per cent volvo per cent henlys
joint venture form intention two manufacturer expand operation north america
dutch company choose partly neither uk sweden acceptable choice party reason besides taxation
joint venture agreement state per cent profit prévost pay up ph bv dividend volvo henlys provide take together prévost ph bv sufficient financial resource pay dividend
issue whether ph bv beneficial owner dividend pay prévost
merely conduit
thing look rather bleak ph bv never employee discernable activity hold share prévost
unfortunately ph bv also tell banker course comply netherlands financial regulatory procedure beneficial owner share prévost fact volvo henlys
canada therefore assert ph bv beneficial owner rate withhold tax per cent apply available recipient also beneficial owner therefore full canadian domestic law withholding tax per cent apply
indofood term beneficial ownership define treaty usual rule term define treaty define accord domestic tax law bring play
canadian domestic law provide relevant domestic law force time definition need rather force time treaty conclude
oecd expert give evidence case state hold company ph bv would normally view beneficial owner dividend receive rather presumption shareholder hold company true beneficial owner
point out oecd report refer double tax conventions use conduit companies envisage conduit company could circumstance still beneficial owner income receive
depend extent power conduit company extent function perform
necessary ask whether conduit company ownership income asset name ie legal title whether enjoy economic legal practical attribute ownership
accord expert requirement beneficial ownership insert oecd model convention explicitly exclude intermediary third state agent nominee treaty benefit
oecd support assumption hold company mere agent nominee shareholder shareholder would automatically consider beneficial owner
refer back oecd report conduit company
accord report long company liable tax country resident long asset give rise income effectively transfer conduit company consider mere agent nominee
court hear dutch law ph bv would definitely regard beneficial owner share prévost base result early dutch case
however legal obligation upon ph bv pass dividend shareholder ph bv would consider beneficial owner dividend
existence agreement ph bv shareholder volvo henlys amount obligation ph bv pass dividend receive
dividend payment authorize ph bv director accordance dutch law
actually dutch law payment large regular dividend consider unusual default scenario netherlands civil code profit distribute shareholder full subject capital maintenance requirement practice avoid dutch company opt delegate shareholder power decide size dividend
course case become apparent term beneficial ownership choose oecd expert use model convention without much thought term might interpret
partly oecd member agree change model convention civil law country term carry far connotation common law country
common law country term multiple meaning
oecd adopt term beneficial ownership
really think mean
recognize law oecd member therefore fallback position definition article double tax treaty state term specifically define treaty give meaning domestic tax law use necessarily appear domestic tax law
multiple meaning oecd member recognize term law none meaning quite fit bill far tax treaty concerned
court resort look phrase several language dictionary help much either
end court settle follow definition
beneficial owner dividend person receive dividend he or she own use enjoyment assume risk control dividend receive
person beneficial owner dividend person enjoy assume attribute ownership
short dividend owner benefit person accountable anyone deal dividend income para
thus shareholder hold company would necessarily treat beneficial owner income receive company unless company conduit absolutely discretion use application income
dividend receive ph bv company could want income director authorize payment dividend volvo henlys regard mere conduit beneficial owner dividend receive prévost
canadian federal court subsequently uphold decision tax court of canada find prévost beneficial owner dividend
notion beneficial owner also argue canadian government velcro canada
velcro canada resident netherlands antilles incorporate intermediary company netherlands assign right receive royalty canadian company sublicencing agreement dutch intermediary netherlands antilles company step stone structure
court follow prévost case find dutch intermediary beneficial owner royalty
canadian government issue invitation public comment possible measure prevent treaty shopping
consultation document outline canada position experience treaty shopping together suggest possible approach prevention treaty shopping
oecd stance term understand treaty context although meaning beneficial ownership domestic law automatically irrelevant
commentary adopt view beneficial owner refer full right enjoy dividend interest royalty without contractually otherwise require pass it on another party
thus use enjoyment refer payment ownership underlying property generate payment
aim move towards international consensus way endorse indofoods decision global concept beneficial ownership need fiscal meaning stand outside domestic legislation
commentator agree oecd stance
city london law society example response oecd discussion draft date suggest tackle problem treaty shopping definition beneficial owner problematic international consensus full right correct test use determine beneficial ownership
approach treaty abuse even conduit vehicle show beneficial ownership income dislike government usually artificial arrangement enter principal purpose access benefit tax treaty underlying party would entitle absence conduit vehicle
oecd report conduit company identify two main type conduit vehicle
direct conduit illustrate diagram para
country conduit company set up tax conduit company income significant extent eg participation arrangement whereby dividend receive subsidiary company exempt corporation tax
step distinguish feature type arrangement country whose tax treaty take advantage relatively high tax country conduit company set up low net profit due high level tax deductible payment third country
case conduit company liable tax significant extent country resident income pass through it end up person would eligible benefit tax treaty use income make journey conduit structure
oecd identify five approach tackle use conduit company double tax treaty possible example actual treaty show

approach treaty benefit deny company directly indirectly person resident one contracting state ie country party treaty
rather drastic approach entail disregard legal status company
identity shareholder would need
approach really appropriate treaty make low tax country risk conduit activity would high
notice example include active
discuss bone fide provision
successful conduit operation require conduit company pay much tax country resident
low tax status achieve take advantage dividend participation exemption simple conduit pay out income form tax deductible expense step stone set up conduit particular type legal entity exempt tax
states could simply exclude certain type legal entity selection treaty benefit

approach conduit company would eligible treaty benefit whole point conduit actually subject tax state resident
however would catch step stone structure perfectly legitimate expense pay out low tax country thus reduce tax bill conduit state virtually nil
company would subject tax might actually pay
approach favour oecd
conduit company control state conduit company resident refuse grant treaty benefit say per cent conduit company income pay out owner tax deductible form
however approach whilst catch conduit arrangement might also catch perfectly innocent commercial arrangement motive test eg would also need

commentary article make clear use state domestic consistent treaty obligation
material add commentary debate whether state apply domestic general decide whether grant treaty benefit treaty conclude prior
perhaps key point make paragraph commentary article
guide principle benefit double tax convention available main purpose enter certain transaction arrangement secure favourable tax position obtain favourable treatment circumstance would contrary object purpose relevant provision
good example use domestic combat treaty abuse seem recent development concern application india gaar combat abuse see para
reliance domestic provision tackle perceive abusive practice however uncertain arguably good way deal treaty shopping tighten up operation dtt introduce clause text treaty

well rely general country domestic law possible country enact specific legislation tackle treaty abuse

however would constitute treaty override
us strongly believe good way tackle treaty shopping specific provision bilateral treaty preclude misuse beneficial treaty treatment resident country party treaty ie third country resident
longstanding us approach say exactly person qualify benefit rather try identify specific situation conduit arrangement might use
current us treaty include limitation benefit provision
channel approach discuss person could conceivably act conduit channel income gain person resident either contract state will qualify benefit treaty
however distinguishing feature us approach degree detail develop channel approach counter treaty abuse

qualify
qualify use counter treaty shopping
state exactly type person will qualify reduce rate tax tax exemption available treaty
typically country will state individual will definitely qualify will set series test pass rate tax set out treaty will apply company legal person
company fail test full domestic rate withhold tax apply unless company persuade tax authority transaction specifically design take advantage tax treaty
qualifying person approach usually adopt us treaty
benefit treaty usual exception mutual agreement article may claim
individual category sometimes include collective investment vehicle
contracting state taxpayer government local authority governmental agency
qualify person
individual government consider unlikely act part conduit arrangement
however legal person must pass least one series test establish whether qualify person
test broadly follow oecd guidance
list test give treaty will comprise follow
publicly trade corporation subsidiary
profit organization pension fund

derivative benefit
active trade business
multinational corporate group headquarters
triangular provision
competent
publicly trade test
broad rationale behind test person wish set up conduit arrangement hardly likely go trouble expense establish maintain company stock exchange list purpose
company meet requirement stock exchange list will company substantial business activity will subject heavy degree regulation stock exchange authority
certain stock exchange recognize specify treaty
normally stock exchange two contracting state will recognize sometimes along list stock exchange
case recent us limitation benefit article treaty member states eu qualify stock exchange treaty state case eu taxpayer stock exchange european economic area eea case us taxpayer state party north american free trade agreement nafta
stock exchange company share trade country company resident requirement primary place management control country company tax resident
enough company share trade recognize stock exchange test must pass list company consider qualify person treaty benefit
test follow class share must trade recognize list treaty stock exchange
principal class company share
class share carry disproportionate benefit eg respect right share profit asset wind up
addition share must regularly trade
mean significant proportion company share must trade significant number day tax year
subsidiary company pass publicly trade test will normally also qualify treaty benefit provide subsidiary parent resident contract state
usual rule subsidiary company will entitle benefit treaty five direct indirect owner least per cent aggregate vote value company share publicly trade company
publicly trade company indirect owner however may requirement intermediate company must resident one contracting state
requirement appear detailed version
profit organization pension fund religious charitable educational scientific artistic cultural organization fulfil public purpose may qualify treaty benefit regardless residence beneficiary member
recent us treaty test whether pension fund qualify person may pass either reference tax residence scheme member reference organization whose pension fund
typically pension fund will qualify treaty benefit least per cent beneficiary member participant individual resident one contracting state organization eg company whose pension scheme sponsor pension fund qualify person ie company qualify treaty benefit
derivative benefit test
broad aim test establish legal person use part conduit arrangement
logic test person would entitle perfectly good treaty benefit one treaty say person unlikely go bother set up treaty shopping arrangement say order extract income gain us treaty rate withhold tax
normally two part test ownership base erosion
company pass test would typically show least voting power value person entitle broadly equivalent treaty benefit treaty another treaty equivalent beneficiary
instance belgian company might qualify benefit
per cent share person resident country treaty us eg suppose resident netherlands
owner consider qualify person
benefit least good offer
per cent company income pay out form tax deductible interest royalty similar type payment person equivalent beneficiary
treaty state company owner resident example netherlands contain limitation benefit article set out qualify necessary show company owner would qualify example fact resident belgium
note include highly detailed qualify example would need company owner demonstrate would capable pass test will show qualify person
us treaty acknowledge taxpayer resident eu might enjoy benefit say eu interest royalties directive good say thus permit comparison reference rate withhold tax lay down directive rather bilateral tax treaty question
derivate benefit test appear many us treaty include oecd propose detailed limitation benefit article develop action beps
us model include derivative benefit test provide company resident contracting state may qualify treaty benefit time benefit would accord company satisfy ownership base erosion test differ slightly exist test current us dtt
derivative benefit test restrictive oecd recommendation ownership requirement stringent intermediate owner account oecd recommendation include base erosion test
active
feature many conduit arrangement conduit company little apart channel dividend interest royalty one country another
person wish take advantage tax treaty properly entitle unlikely go trouble set up fully active trading company foreign state save bit withhold tax
thus company active trade business will normally consider conduit company even set out fail ie qualify person may still qualify treaty benefit
rule usually word taxpayer resident state will entitle treaty benefit treaty active business test will generally apply corporate group rather rigidly individual company
thus company state share company pay income state directly perhaps pay entity indirectly payer recipient member corporate group
company will connect another company per cent control
test contain element subjectivity instance will activity consider substantial will activity consider complementary another activity
us model contain active business test restrictive previous model apply relation activity related person line business
keen attract headquarters multinational company tax jurisdiction
however exclude benefit country tax treaty would severely reduce appeal country headquarters location
hence sometimes special test headquarters company count qualify person might otherwise pass test
typically headquarters company multinational corporate group will qualify person supervise number company country
note supervision rather ownership key
contain following list requirement must meet order legal person ie not necessarily company pass multinational corporate
must provide substantial portion overall supervision administration group
must consist corporation resident engage active trade business least five country turn contribute substantially least per cent income generate group
business activity carry on one country headquarters company state residence must generate less gross income group
per cent headquarters company gross income may derive contracting state
must exercise independent discretionary authority carry out overall supervision and administration function
must subject generally applicable income taxation rule country residence
income derive contracting state must derive connection incidental active business activity refer
us model include headquarters test unlike current treaty require headquarters exercise primary management and control function

include use treaty recognize collective investment scheme civ resident ie treat opaque rather transparent
civ regard tax resident specific rule may need likely civ will pass test share beneficial interest trade stock exchange interest scheme will probably hold person resident either contract states distribution make civ tax deductible fail engage active conduct business
probable wording civ rule would civ qualify person
extent time beneficial interest civ resident contract state collective investment vehicle establish equivalent beneficiary

beps action principal purpose test

oecd also recommend rule deal potential situation two minority shareholder resident different country act concert control company
however rule already provide shareholding potential cfc related company amalgamated act would already cover legislation
would relatively unusual two unrelated shareholder separate country act concert control third company
oecd consider whether cfc rule apply foreign subsidiary whether also apply partnership trust pe
many country cfc rule apply type entity foreign subsidiary
problematic entity recognize tax purpose one country ie opaque ie transparent
particular oecd consider question hybrid entity company cfc
treat transparent cfc jurisdiction total income cfc will sum cfc income plus transparent entity
cfc rule also less effective cfc receive interest payment technically taxable cfc low tax country recognize tax purpose hold company country
happen entity pay interest consider opaque country payer recipient resident country try impose charge cfc legislation
check box regulation permit low tier foreign group member subsidiary cfcs regard branch cfc thus eliminate passive income receipt us tax purpose
subsidiary cfc know us tax purpose hybrid branch
consider figure
cfc rule enact strong pressure us treasury repeal

eliminate related party passive income passive income payment make related cfc cfc us shareholder
thus illustrate figure us shareholder might company resident bermuda
bermudan company receive passive income subsidiary generate tax deduction country subsidiary tax resident rule would exclude income income bermudan company would form basis cfc charge us shareholder
temporary measure introduce extend several time still existence
resurrect idea close loophole us cfc regime
particular propose branch will treat cfcs thus negate advantage foreign subsidiary cfc treat branch
example figure even botswana subsidiary treat branch us tax purpose royalty income pay botswana branch bermudan subsidiary would still vulnerable us cfc charge us shareholder bermudan company
however another extend rule permanently albeit imposition minimum tax part wide budget proposal
time writing seem unlikely budget proposal will implement rather president trump announce outline plan change us tax code little detail supply specific reference cfc legislation date
solution put forward introduce modify hybrid mismatch rule
would operate include interest payment entity cfc charge country interest type payment would include cfc income parent jurisdiction country classify entity eg entity way payer payee jurisdiction ie countries
however suggestion make oecd rather firm recommendation
decide level foreign tax imply foreign country use tax haven choice whether look headline rate effective rate
effective rate choose question decisive examine percentage effective rate would apply cfc tax resident shareholder country
alternatively country might publish list country consider tax haven apply cfc rule irrespective actual rate tax charge country list
final report beps action discuss whether tax rate exemption cfc legislation desirable

two type tax rate exemption identify
fix benchmark approach tax rate cfc country compare choose minimum tax rate
relative approach benchmark set term effective tax rate suffer cfc percentage effective tax rate would charge cfc income shareholder country
effective rate less apply passive income
tax credit accompany dividend must also take account calculate effective rate
counter device whereby malta apply high effective rate passive income german maltese company appear cfcs negate effect high taxation refund tax charge shareholder way tax credit
effective rate tax less
uk level tax unimportant define company cfc first instance
however exemption cfc charge base whether effective rate tax foreign country least uk tax income would
income subject foreign tax us rate exempt know high tax kickout
country may good reason suppose country either frequently use deferral income case country actually quite unlikely would use tax avoidance deferral
hence use black list white list common
white list perhaps politically acceptable name country blacklist inevitably make political diplomatic relation country difficult
uk white list use
foreign company white list none income apportion uk shareholder
however certain condition must meet exemption apply
us blacklist country us require participate international boycott country us sever diplomatic relation
oecd observe list country black white make easy decide cfc rule apply provide measure certainly taxpayer
use white list recommend
cfc legislation seek tax passive income cfcs
foreign subsidiary trade location trade almost certainly choose accord commercial factor rather simply low tax rate offer
thus active income commonly exclude cfc charge resident shareholder
point difference whether capital gain cover cfc legislation country take view capital gain may accrue period year may include period foreign company cfc
also always possible determine value asset increase due investment trading activity
well income invest cfc legislation also commonly cover call base company income
income distribution company set up low tax regime
company usually take delivery goods service question buy fellow group company low price sell usually external customer high price
group profit sale external customer book low tax country reduce group tax liability
overlap cfc legislation transfer pricing legislation price charge group company ought examine transfer pricing regime group company sell base company low tax country
however country effective transfer pricing legislation
case cfc rule will state transfer pricing adjustment must take account determine position cfc legislation
decide income cfc purpose
state although number approach identify income catch cfc rule general principle cfc rule apply income separate underlying value creation order obtain reduction tax
typical example would company resident high tax country develop ip transfer ip asset group company low tax country
transferee company one receive royalty income although involve value creation ie development ip
country might either base rule category income analysis cfc
foreign company identify cfc country need decide resident shareholder will suffer cfc charge base income cfc whether cfc income will divide active passive income
latter case resident shareholder cfc charge would base passive income cfc
approach decide overarching question influence way cfc system develop
income categorize eg either dividend interest royalty sale service income cfc rule apply income specify category
underlie assumption certain class income passive thus vulnerable cfc charge active vulnerable
create difficulty dividend receive cfc automatically vulnerable cfc charge rule need examine whether dividend pay trading income case dividend would vulnerable cfc charge shareholder
rule would need deal house invoicing company base company pure sale commission income disguise trading income
look income really derive
approach well suited cfc regime focus parent company base strip income really income resident parent company artificially shift foreign subsidiary
substance approach similar source
uk include approach cfc regime
substance analysis rule fall three category
substantial contribution analysis value create
employee create
viable independent entity analysis likely cfc would asset bear level risk bear independent entity rather group member
employee establishment analysis cfc core function perform employee premise
case core function really carry on employee shareholder company shareholder premise shareholder country
approach bear resemblance approach verify group transfer price beps action rely concept significant person function
reinforce fact cfc and transfer pricing rule overlap
approach use anywhere present suggest oecd
instead categorize income cfc passive active income target passive income excess profit approach seek identify income cfc excess normal return cfc activity
critic tax executives institute us base association tax professional consider type approach aim narrow range tax avoidance use cfcs categorization approach universal use present retain
type tax avoidance activity would catch excess profit approach instance cfc locate low tax jurisdiction receive excessive ip income
fundamental criticism excess profit approach would apply transfer pricing rule apply
transfer pricing rule operate efficiently excess profit ought reallocate group company bring tax
group company still profit excess normal return likely transfer pricing rule partially effective
beps action aim improve transfer pricing rule include new rule cover pricing difficult value transaction royalty charge unique ip company group
exemption
oecd recommend number exemption cfc charge
de minimis threshold cfc charge shareholder income cfc certain threshold
cfc legislation expensive use hardly income cfc little point go expense impose cfc charge resident shareholder

cfc rule apply mainly tax avoidance motive existence cfc
tax rate exemption cfc rule apply cfc resident country low tax rate
table summarize type income subject cfc legislation group country indicate principal exemption
cfc high level active income least income may exempt cfc rule entity approach
base company income ie group distributor company extent group practice catch transfer pricing rule

chapter
tax evasion basics
chapter consider illegal use tax haven evade tax income locate investment tax haven capital income country residence might tackle
consider use legislation previous chapter chapter consider detail form action take relation tax haven particular curb use illegal evasion tax individual
oecd encourage finance minister long history develop initiative respect
tax haven use legitimately illegitimately
legitimate use invest fund carry out certain activity usually financial tax haven full disclosure make income profit gain arise tax authority taxpayer resident
this may well result tax saving taxpayer benefit system double tax relief exemption country residence
note chapter though system double tax relief exemption apply active oppose passive income credit relief apply passive income
country also often restrict exemption method corporate taxpayer rather individual trust must still use credit method
discourage legitimate use tax haven difficult prevent illegitimate use impossible
illegitimate use depend nondisclosure income profit gain arise tax haven country taxpayer residence
combination dishonest taxpayer tax haven operate policy secrecy make unlikely country residence will able tax income arise tax haven will unable find out
legislation ineffective against illegitimate use tax haven case often apply corporate taxpayer
main initiative promote oecd use government around world reduce illegal evasion tax hide asset income tax haven
establishment oecd global forum transparency exchange information global forum early later restructure
inclusiveness membership currently member system peer review may reduce availability secrecy would tax evader may improve ability small tax haven comply information exchange procedure
first round peer review exchange information request eior assign rating jurisdiction vast majority rate compliant largely compliant
second round peer review will evaluate progress challenging eoir standard
article oecd model tax treaty exchange information strengthen extend considerably
major change information exchange long necessary merely foreseeably relevant
information request double tax treaty dtt even request state need information tax purpose
states permit decline supply information grounds banking secrecy

oecd model tax information exchange agreement largely adopt hundred bilateral tax information exchange agreement tiea
effectiveness agreement yet prove although undoubtedly useful certain case
mutual convention administrative assistance taxation multilateral treaty exchange information optionally assistance collection tax
widely regard laudable advance fight against illegal use tax haven although still early assess effective likely
oecd introduce common reporting standard crs automatic exchange information aeoi tax purpose accompany multilateral treaty enable tax authority communicate directly multilateral competent authority agreement
many country sign up early adopter
measure voluntary country force join although participate initiative country signal intention abandon banking secrecy engage exchange information will make hard citizen haven country hide offshore income
us introduce fatca legislation foreign account tax compliance act force bank financial institution around word report account hold us citizen irs check whether citizen declare offshore asset income us tax return

besides bilateral multilateral measure fatca many country offer offshore voluntary disclosure facility ovdp usually consist partial amnesty respect penalty charge failure disclose offshore income
appear reasonably successful may deterrent effect beyond taxpayer actually make use
measure apply against tax haven summarize table
threat sanction heart supranational initiative against tax haven
oecd actively pursue measure limit use tax haven since late
first oecd focus fact low tax rate use country form competition attract foreign investment
campaign against call harmful tax competition pursue discuss
campaign founder due two main factor
country target oecd respond oecd pressure make case many oecd member act tax haven usually offer favourable tax regime limited circumstance
instance many oecd country offer special tax regime aim persuade multinational group locate finance company within territory
terrorist activity particular attack new york prompt supranational body vigilant monitor ownership financial investment tax haven
cut off funding terrorist illegal organization see vital part strategy clamp down terrorism around world
initiative force tax haven hand over information ownership asset income become important persuade tax haven give up low tax rate
nevertheless initiative eliminate harmful tax competition important step towards current position country either still use regard tax haven concept tax competition examine
tax competition generally refer competition different tax jurisdiction encourage business locate operation
may take form overall lowering tax rate specific measure tax holiday enterprise meet certain specify criterion grant favourable tax treatment limited period follow move new country
reason attract foreign investment many commentator organization opinion harmful considerable debate recent year constitute harmful tax competition deal global level
country may use tax system compete attract portfolio investment foreign direct investment
portfolio investment essentially investment involve run business
include bank deposit hold government security minority holding company share
bank deposit bond holding eg eurobonds highly mobile easily switch one country another
foreign direct investment hand involve set up subsidiary company branch another country
arguably tax competition result fiscal degradation
mean essentially loss revenue country engage lowering tax income derive capital investment ultimately erosion tax base
competition intensify tax rate reduce even far mean less less revenue derive foreign investment
one view winner multinational firm shareholder
one potential loser intensify tax competition tend labour country get majority tax revenue tax upon earnings
shortfall corporation tax usually make up
hand fiscal sovereignty illusory tax competitive worldalthough country may perceive freedom set rate wish reality force set rate accord rival
large extent tax policy dictate internationally mobile taxpayer rather correct aim impose reasonable part cost public expenditure every production factor industrial domestic fixed mobile
country compete foreign direct investment will want offer competitive corporation tax rate tax break capital investment
countries compete portfolio investment will want offer low zero rate tax opportunity invest discreetly investment bring attention investor home country tax authority
competition relation portfolio investment take form impose low withholding tax outbound payment interest dividend royalty combine low tax income earn investment
combine banking secrecy great temptation taxpayer declare income home tax authority
issue confine traditional tax haven
country preferential regime certain type income payment eg london eurobond market enjoy exemption withhold tax
represent huge amount tax foregone uk the year fund raise eurobond issue main uk market amount
end oecd pursue initiative aim prevent term harmful tax competition see chapter
attempt pressure tax haven cease offer favourable tax term foreign investor give up banking secrecy
however apply foreign direct investment portfolio investment controversy whether anything wrong country offer favourable tax rate attract foreign direct investment
problem oecd definition harmful tax competition many oecd member involve practice tax haven largely refuse succumb oecd demand
demand accompany plan oecd member apply sanction against country deem act tax haven
nature sanction might use against country decline oecd new approach make explicit london
subject jurisdiction act tax haven summit communiqué state stand ready deploy sanction protect public finances financial system
era banking secrecy
since four main strand activity aim lift banking secrecy make easy country find out income resident earn abroad pursue oecd centrally individual member state
encouraging country oecd enter bilateral tax information exchange agreement tiea bilateral dtt exist two country concern
encouraging country participate global tax forum seek promote minimum standard tax transparency via system peer review
encouraging country oecd sign up tax matter
encourage country adopt oecd common reporting standard automatic exchange information tax purpose
four strand aim mainly prevent tax evasion wealthy individual trust illegally hide income tax haven declare country tax resident
many country include many small island tax haven persuade enter bilateral tiea oecd member state
oecd develop model tax information exchange agreement

agreement make
question remain member country would agree form oecd country matter tax competition information exchange
answer lie nature informal sanction could easily enforce against country
instance the irs us make know us taxpayer think bank account jersey could expect us tax return closely scrutinize could expect pay full amount tax penalty due without mitigation would bad business jersey
another reason concern fragile constitutional position caribbean tax haven us also relationship british crown dependencies overseas territories include channel islands gibraltar turks caicos islands name uk
whilst territory traditionally permit increase participation affair us uk means impossible
effect combined result flurry signing tiea
besides signing tiea many country notably switzerland also amend dtt reflect standard exchange information set oecd model convention
loosely speak country expect sign least tiea least dtt contain full exchange information article
danger set numerical target signing information exchange agreement run risk tax haven will simply sign agreement one another agreement will never use practice
figure show breakdown partner country exchange information agreement agreement make country
oecd state per cent tiea amendment exist dtt sign jurisdiction implement require standard information exchange see para insist initiative number game oecd
however total tiea represent substantial implementation standard probable many target country whose requisite tiea likely use
even partner country consider tax haven situation agreement quite unlikely use much
instance faroe islands helpfully enter agreement useful tax information exchange agreement
tiea imperfect tool combate international tax evasion money laundering use tax haven
instance para tax information agreement jersey us read follow
request information make party shall frame great degree specificity possible
case request shall specify write follow
identity taxpayer examination period time respect information request nature information request matter request party tax law respect information seek reason believe information request foreseeably relevant material tax administration enforcement request party statement request party pursue reasonable means available territory obtain information
request meet jersey may decline request
realistically us will party make request
us must already know information require jersey
view like us little seek confirmation already know many case
note requirement information foreseeably relevant mirror standard set exchange information version article oecd mtc
another limitation information exchange however will effective information exchange reliable important feature agreement enhance information exchange appropriate standard respect accounting record
couple criticism note regard fact many agreement make country might reasonably regard tax haven faroe islands country convenience usefulness tieas author opinion highly questionable
unclear whether information will ever make public substantiate usefulness statistics number request make meet country
meantime evident oecd member country rely solely information exchange agreement counter tax evasion
discuss next section many oecd member act independently initiative aim counter use tax haven
although still early reach firm conclusion usefulness tiea seem likely history will judge costly diversion effort away strategy chance success reduce opportunity tax evasion conceal investment country act tax haven
particular might good oecd push country sign up multilateral automatic exchange information treaty rather encourage proliferation tiea
possibly degree pressure exert oecd follow financial crash cause oecd concentrate tiea strategy would produce quick result term agreement sign give least appearance progress
global forum

tax theorist sometimes argue corporation tax nature double taxation call economic double taxation
even recommend corporation tax abolish altogether
profit company make will eventually taxable hand shareholder either form dividend capital gain
whilst company frequently exempt pay tax dividend capital gain individual shareholder
see chapter para absence relief profit company make tax first hand profit distribute shareholder dividend shareholder pay income tax
alternatively company pay dividend keep cash generate profit spend asset thus boost asset base company thus make company share worth
shareholder eventually sell he or she share capital gain large would company dividend
dividend dividend company profit effectively tax twice
main problem argument eliminate corporation tax shareholder may live tax haven thus escape tax dividend gain although dividend send known tax haven usually suffer withhold tax
also shareholder resident country might exempt tax instance pension fund large holder share quote company
even shareholder pay tax dividend pay company case tax authority will wait share sell taxpayer capital gain become taxable
might many year profit earn
corporation tax charge annually mean tax authority receive tax revenue quickly wait shareholder sell share
practical note corporation tax remove revenue would replace possibly increase vat income tax likely unpopular vote public

thus aoi manage control ireland
although register able take advantage exception resident status irish incorporated company
effect tax purpose stateless company
subsidiary company resident country will probably pay corporation tax tax authority country resident
pay dividend dividend ultimately receive say aoi one stateless company
profit accrue aoi necessarily escape tax altogether
however vital point liable tax us
type arrangement apple put place may illustrate follow see tax payable would uk tax assume dividend pay irish company us company
irish company tax residence anywhere could receive dividend interest uk company without incur irish tax
however uk company make payment interest irish company irish company tax resident ireland would benefit interest payment would subject uk withhold tax rate per cent
uk company pay dividend irish company would reduce taxable profit uk would withholding tax uk law
apple operations international report gather profit subsidiary form dividend

key question us parent tax dividend income result us control foreign company legislation subpart rule

price charge ruritanian company irish distribution company set high likely ruritanian tax authority would invoke transfer pricing legislation try establish arm length price ought
however discuss chapter transfer pricing dispute taxpayer hold substantial informational advantage even adjust price may arm length price
transfer pricing legislation thus limit tax planning eliminate completely
evidence subcommittee indicate apple uk group member record profit whilst france germany group company pay corporation tax
despite three country welldevelop transfer pricing legislation
besides use check attribution distributor company profit us parent subpart also avoid distributor company perform activity relation goods
however rather require say irish distributor company perform physical manufacturing activity relation goods question us rule merely require distributor company make substantial contribution

concept appear design extend exemption subpart income derive manufacture activity abroad also mere supervision contract manufacturing another party
another exception subpart rule use apple

us parent liability subpart relation income receive foreign subsidiary incorporate country receive fellow foreign subsidiary thus income receive one irish subsidiary another would subject subpart rule
afford additional protection subpart dividend receive aoi asi subsidiary

bosal holding
netherlands tax system particularly famous two feature
participation exemption regime dividend receive foreign shareholding
refusal allow deduction interest pay connection financing foreign subsidiary

reasoning behind disallowance interest funding foreign subsidiary profit subsidiary subject netherlands taxation

interest deduction would matter favour taxpayer
bosal holding challenge refusal grant deduction interest pay grounds contravene freedom establishment principle

cjeu decide netherlands law impediment freedom establishment
could justify netherlands law basis principle fiscal cohesion
principle use member states defend apparently discriminatory practice would regards tax deduction
reason case netherlands permit netherlands subsidiary parent company member states deduct netherlands profit cost relation parent company expense
word system already lack fiscal cohesion benefit netherlands
neither could justify denial interest deduction principle territoriality parent subsidiary separate company
netherlands could reasonably expect tax jurisdiction foreign subsidiary
netherlands estimate loss bosal holding decision immediately annually
give annual corporation tax revenue around substantial blow
netherlands government react decision remove interest deduction funding respect domestic subsidiary thereby remove discrimination
also introduce thin capitalization rule place additional restriction use tax loss hold company
case concern levy french dividend pay netherlands hold company enter force
withholding tax levy dividend pay french shareholder
netherlands shareholder object netherlands dividend subject participation exemption netherlands tax payable
thus french per cent withholding tax constitute real tax burden
addition french netherlands shareholder treat differently
reason near exemption tax hand french corporate shareholder alleviate economic double taxation profit subject tax twice within country hand company earn hand shareholder receive profit form dividend
cjeu hold state relieve economic double taxation resident must also extend relief economic double taxation would arise
netherlands shareholder could obtain relief french tax profit use pay dividend suffer economic double taxation french corporation tax profit earn french company french withholding tax profit pay netherlands company dividend

finland wish grant shareholder tax credit base corporation tax suffer profit use pay dividend could take account corporation tax pay swedish company
fact would mean tax receipt finland would fall would receive corporation tax swedish company assist finnish tax authority

luxembourg domestic law deny carry forward loss except against income economically earn luxembourg thus profit french head office establishment count also branch keep branch account comply luxembourg rule
luxembourg demand must economic link loss carry forward income earn member state tax charge loss arise taxpayer activity state carry forward
however luxembourg resident company would able carry forward loss against income source trade produce loss
court of justice rule system accordance principle territoriality thus give rise discrimination
resident taxpayer theory taxable worldwide income fact justify allow resident company offset loss bring forward arise source give rise profit
however rule order permit offset loss bring forward branch account keep luxembourg premise accordance luxembourg law hold go beyond stated object rule

taxpayer win case grounds denial loss relief amount infringement right establishment establish luxembourg produce tax disadvantage
case notable overt approval show court of justice principle territoriality

question case whether loss subsidiary company member states could offset against uk profit parent company

despite street protest paris devotee sensible underwear subsidiary cease trade
argue right freedom establishment infringe bad off subsidiary tax resident france belgium germany subsidiary tax resident uk
corporate group specifically define purpose icta right offset tax loss profit within group
loss relief claim
cjeu conclude provision generally prevent resident parent company deduct taxable profit loss incur another member state subsidiary constitute infringement article freedom establishment
however case subsidiary exhaust possibility utilise loss member state denial offset against parent company profit would constitute infringement right freedom establishment
thus france belgium germany cease trade possibility loss offset country either the future uk hmrc oblige permit offset loss against uk taxable profit uk parent company
partial victory uk hmrc verdict give automatic right offset taxable profit loss within group member one member state
uk offer three argument loss subsidiary offset against profit resident company
first need protect balanced allocation power impose tax uk subsidiary country
profit loss two side coin must treat symmetrically tax system
general right offset loss could damage tax base certain member states
group would able choose allocate loss thus gain ability reduce tax liability member states high effective rate tax
time tax base member state loss make subsidiary resident would increase
would result unbalanced allocation power impose tax member states
assume loss use one member state
uk tax authority argue principle territoriality apply foreign subsidiary beyond uk tax jurisdiction
argument fiscal cohesion also advance direct link group relief grant loss incur surrender company taxation profit claimant company
however fiscal cohesion argument weak case plus minus occur different legal entity
secondly loss take consideration parent company member state might well take account twice
cjeu sympathy view agree danger avoid rule preclude relief respect loss subsidiary
however general restriction loss offset consider disproportionate prevent double relief hence decision loss subsidiary resident member states could offset against parent company profit circumstance possibility offset subsidiary member states
thirdly loss take account member state subsidiary establish would risk tax avoidance
cjeu accept group would naturally attempt utilise loss country would save great amount tax principle proportionality use overrule argument
general ban offset loss disproportionate response threat
bosal case reduction tax revenue regard overriding reason public interest may rely justify member state adopt rule infringe fundamental freedom

however automatic right loss relief eu member state rather state loss generate would seriously undermine balanced allocation power tax
decision
justification put forward finnish tax authority allow effective offset loss against profit would undermine balance tax right finland uk would risk tax avoidance group seek utilise loss member states suffer high effective rate tax
allow company choice member state claim loss relief would undermine balance power tax amongst member states
court of justice also consider likelihood group enter taxavoidance scheme base choice state use loss

case concern application original mutual assistance directive directive annual french tax levy french immovable property value
france seek levy tax luxembourg resident would exempt french resident even though double tax treaty dtt two country contain clause facilitate exchange information
however treaty apply certain type hold company elisa luxembourg hold company

france grant exemption annual tax french resident foreign resident country france treaty administrative assistance combat tax evasion avoidance france dtt contain
obtain exemption certain information disclose french tax authority detail property identity address company shareholder member detail shareholding tax residence
luxembourg permit domestic law disclose information shareholder hold company exchange information company note exclude ambit dtt
however information could theory obtain mutual assistance directive
french tax authority request ruling court of justice whether requirement grant exemption accordance tfeu freedom provide service freedom movement capital
freedom establishment point order benefit freedom taxpayer must permanent presence host member state
permanent presence consist immovable property property must actively manage merely hold investment
denial exemption hold restriction freedom movement capital
exemption would grant conditional upon requirement additional impose french resident ie application treaty
foreign taxpayer control whether treaty exist applicable
court move on consider whether restriction justify
french justify restriction grounds aim prevention tax evasion overriding requirement general interest
hold previous case acceptable justification restriction fundamental freedom
next question whether restriction ie denial exemption proportionate whether less measure might appropriate
prevention tax evasion justification deny fundamental freedom legislation question direct wholly artificial arrangement objective circumvent tax law
measure enact presumption affect engage tax evasion acceptable grounds deny fundamental freedom
court hold france could frame denial exemption differently
instead blanket denial require treaty existence applicable could restrict denial exemption case taxpayer company fail supply required information
france fail provide foreign company opportunity supply information voluntarily without recourse tax authority
denial exemption luxembourg company therefore restriction freedom movement capital unlawful
resident
liechtenstein member eea thus resident enjoy four fundamental freedom include freedom movement capital

even though foreign company could supply necessary shareholding information france would way check liechtenstein tax authority
distinguish elisa court note mutual assistance directive apply liechtenstein member eu
elisa slight chance france could obtain information luxembourg whereas rimbaud chance obtain information liechtenstein
court decide france entitle deny liechtenstein company exemption immovable property tax
importance case court of justice state clearly transaction taxpayer eu member states member eea member eu take place different legal context
eu case law concern restriction exercise fundamental freedom automatically apply
taxpayer win case court of justice certain tax practice tax authority hold constitute restriction one fundamental freedom usually case taxpayer position claim tax refund
practice tax authority hold contravention tfeu therefore unlawful many taxpayer also find position claim refund either income wrongly charge tax deduction wrongly deny
claim often result litigation often bring on group basis number aggrieved taxpayer band together bring action against tax authority seek compensation
neither original case settle court of justice rule question put national court
national court use answer reach decision
verdict court of justice original case therefore good view beginning rather conclusion
right taxpayer repayment tax hold charge unlawfully eu law first examine san georgio case
case taxpayer pay health inspection charge find unlawful eu
court of justice hold entitlement repayment charge levy member state contrary rule eu law consequence adjunct right confer upon individual eu provision prohibit charge effect equal customs duty
national condition repayment may less favourable relate similar claim regard national charge principle equivalence
member states allow make condition obtain repayment onerous reality one would likely ever get money back application principle effectiveness
however taxpayer pay tax make bad off unlawful tax instance trader pass unlawful tax burden customer form high price repayment might make
principle unjust enrichment obtain refund tax pass on customer would relevant
group litigation order glo administrative cost save facility enable many similar case hear
representative case select group examination court
although commonly think tax case technically claim restitution damages comply tax law hold incompatible eu law
claim damages possible sufficiently serious breach eu law direct causal link unlawful tax loss damage sustain taxpayer
damages claim make one uk case seek tax refund thin cap glo
pay tax due simple example claim might bring taxpayer also look beyond immediate effect unlawful provision
instance believe group company face high effective rate tax group might direct loss surrender company whereas absence unlawful tax provision might well surrender group company
company whose taxable profit affect unlawful provision group company necessarily one end up pay tax would company without loss surrender ie group company

manner make claim whether claim make within applicable time limit also dispute

chapter
chapter consider several possible model consumption tax
vat commonly use broad base indirect tax consumption
vat system normally allow export without vat charge vat payable importer
ensure vat due country consumption take place
know destination system
importer must account vat purchase directly tax authority rather pay vat foreign supplier
usually also make claim input tax equivalent amount provide make exempt supply
thus vat neutral whether trader purchase import goods service make purchase domestic market
vat indirect tax adopt eu ethos single market dictate normal way deal import export suitable trade
single market require goods pass freely member states without tax pay border
eu give up goal implement definitive system register trader charge vat eu customer regardless member state base concentrate make pragmatic improvement transitional system

principal indirect tax encounter international trade custom excise duty
unlike vat recoverable business represent real cost
eu customs union mean custom duty pay accord single eu system point goods enter eu movement goods within eu
excise duty hand levy separately state eu although attempt harmonization rate scope excise duty vary widely lead problem excessive shopping smuggling
customs excise duty particularly important develop country due relative ease collect
chapter start review vat work issue arise vat customs duty international trade
go examine vat custom duty system operate within eu particular vat issue arise trade
country world operate system vat major consumption tax although develop country custom duty sometimes great importance
us alone amongst member country oecd federal national system vat individual state collect tax revenue via indirect tax sale tax form consumption tax resemble vat
federal vat would thus duplicate individual state tax system
note many commentator believe us ought federal consumption tax current proposal new trump administration include border adjustment would fill gap
vat important factor planning minimize tax international trade although often matter optimize cash flow vat merely collect business behalf government rather bear business
customs duty though levy import goods real cost import firm refundable
vat usually levy export usually payable taxpayer home country import
unlike direct tax corporation tax income tax vat system generally self contain country will charge vat resident rather anyone buy goods service within territory
value add tax vat indirect consumption tax
mean tax pay result purchase goods service rather result earn income
business register vat will charge vat customer
will pay vat tax authority deduct vat charge supplier
several type vat system simple system subtraction vat system addition vat system vat compute reference taxpayer periodic account
instance subtraction vat will calculate vat due apply vat rate sale minus purchase
addition method vat take sum enterprise profit wage bill depreciation interest rent pay apply vat rate total
addition method vat effectively charge factor production employ business
however country use vat
method vat charge individual sale invoice
obtain credit vat purchase set against vat collect customer firm must able produce valid purchase invoice evidence vat pay
vat system category sale exempt vat
confuse apply widely uk technically vat charge rate
exemption normally apply category goods service socially desirable necessarily run make profit health care education
system also exempt financial service category transaction land grounds difficult compute value add transaction nature
problem exemption firm make sale exempt item vat may reclaim credit associated purchase
hence vat charge import goods service make order make sale exempt item import vat will reclaimable
avoid need small business comply vat system country will set turnover threshold determine whether firm must register vat hence charge vat sale
turnover threshold vary widely around world
register firm must charge vat sale may reclaim vat suffer purchase
several method operate vat
subtraction addition method compute tax due business accord global figure often take profit and loss account
hard tax authority enforce although japan use subtraction method
appropriate standard bookkeeping country poor government keen keep cost business comply vat system bare minimum
credit invoice method unlike subtraction addition method require register business keep record every transaction either charge vat charge vat supplier
system extent credit claim vat pay unless supplier give purchaser business proper invoice
thus customer demand proper invoice make much hard seller either sell without charge vat appear charge vat pay it over tax authority
basic vat may illustrate follow assume business make sale business vat chargeable per cent
business notice vat collect stage supply chain merely sale final consumer
know stage sometimes refer fractionate nature vat
first example burden vat fall final consumer
second example involve exempt supply illustrate imperfect nature vat system
ideally vat flow business exemption interfere
vat commonly charge class transaction include limit sale consideration
vat also charge gift instance business take goods use
reason deal vat usual refer supply rather sale
associated vat know output vat
purchase usually refer input associate vat know input vat
many business make mixture supply vat chargeable taxable exempt vat
business know partially exempt
determine whether input vat may reclaim input must match related output supply
input vat may relate directly particular supply eg vat overhead
uk usual way deal partial reclaim allow proportion vat overhead reclaim determine proportion taxable supply make compare total supply

thus business per cent supply make taxable may normally reclaim per cent vat suffer overhead
category input partial reclaim vat may appropriate certain land transaction expenditure computer system
uk special apply prevent manipulation percentage recoverable vat large transaction
note alternative calculation possible instance base number transaction various type
basic issue international vat decide place taxation country permit tax transaction
place use determine
broadly place taxation place consumption probably customer country
determine place taxation difficult customer vat register business business might final consumer
rather destination goods place business use
different rule tend apply
effectively two alternative way treat international supply vat
destination system export supplier charge vat vat charge customer import tax authority country customer locate
origin system vat charge export supplier country supplier base
real international consensus method use country use one method another country use different method different kind supply although destination system common consider align place taxation place consumption good origin system
also country include us many tax haven charge vat
variety treatment mean transaction might suffer double charge vat export import might suffer vat
consider figure
ability rebate vat export important factor country international competitiveness
gatt see permit rebate indirect tax export properly quantify
key factor behind adoption effectively vat australia place previous wholesale sale tax
international framework oecd guidelines
oecd active develop guideline deal aspect vat since late start consumption tax guidance series report

oecd finally issue aim promote international trade via reduce uncertainty matter vat treatment transaction
aim ensure transaction either tax twice tax vat purpose
guidelines purely advisory nature expect continue develop add line change conduct international trade
although focus guideline supply service intangible deal trade generally
theoretically vat use destination system vat suppose tax consumption ideally charge country consumption take place ie country consumer resident
use destination system trade mean supplier charge vat
instead vat collect directly consumer tax authority purchaser
purchaser vat register relatively easy difficulty purchaser vat register impractical try keep track many small purchase many individual
even purchaser vat register system imperfect general principle vat indirect tax pay part purchase price compromise vat collect directly government purchaser
ideally foreign supplier would charge vat part purchase price transfer vat collect government purchaser country
know use origin system proxy destination system
oecd unreservedly advocate destination principle oecd guidelines
pure origin system remove enforcement problem inherent destination system
supplier firm charge vat export domestic law ie example law far eastern country rather uk law supplier country tax authority jurisdiction need enforce collection vat supplier
major point favour origin system tax value create within country border
however overarching principle vat tax consumption rather purely value add despite name
favour origin system eliminate major weakness destination system vat break vat chain result supply make vat free
destination system whilst theoretically pure permit large scale fraud within eu due vat export eu system cashless accounting import vat
however country adopt pure origin vat system may put business competitive disadvantage two way
import will cheap citizen buy import country rebate vat export low vat rather buy home produce goods service
export country business charge vat export will disadvantage try sell customer country low vat will give credit foreign vat
competition issue serious government
origin system resident buy import instead home produce product government will collect vat importantly country business will less profit tax will provide less employment
extreme situation business may even relocate another country avoid high rate vat take profit investment employment
theoretical problem large part uk online bet industry move offshore gibraltar order avoid tax bet duty rather vat issue similar
response uk government drastically reduce tax bet order persuade industry remain uk really option vat revenue raise vat account large proportion total tax revenue
despite drawback new zealand goods services tax gst might classify origin system
vat impose accord residence supplier
supply goods consider take place new zealand goods new zealand time supply
supply service deem taxable new zealand service render new zealand
new zealand protect against buyer prefer import home supply impose vat import goods service
chinese system
china actively use vat system influence activity chinese firm respect export
since export certain highly pollute product carry vat domestic sale exporter prevent reclaim input vat
china also attempt discourage export high volume low value add item clothes shoe restrict amount input vat may reclaim exporter
hand china reward exporter high technology product permit zero rating export sale full reclaim input vat
export goods destination system place supply

destination system use rule need govern sale domestic sale vat must charge domestic sale
vat pay government consumer customer government supplier
word necessary determine territory supply make
taxpayer resident country sell goods customer country time sale make goods locate country country might consider sale make within territory
thus vat would charge country rule account tax authority supplier resident country service carry out perhaps country kind rule know place
concept place supply determine supply make vat purpose therefore determine country allow charge vat supply
usual rule
goods transport supplier country customer country customer different country place supply will supplier country transport begin
however vat will normally payable supply supplier country country zero rate supply export
zero rating enable supplier reclaim input tax purchase associate export sale
country use procedure vat export sale must account purchaser purchaser government
way place supply differ place taxation
goods leave supplier country place taxation supplier country regardless location customer
goods supplier country date sale place supply supplier country location goods time sale
although rule may fairly simple understand administrative consequence firm resident country register country considerable expensive
staff sell company will familiarize vat system country register vat make vat return addition continue register vat country
country require nonresident supplier register vat country make supply vat equivalent pe
country eg canada uk require organize concert sporting event similar within territory account vat admission fee
thus entertainment promoter resident us arrange say rihanna appear wembley arena us promoter would liable charge vat ticket price pass this on hmrc
country south africa require involve install equipment supply country register vat charge vat contract price even though installation contract might constitute pe corporation tax purpose import goods destination system reverse
destination system instead pay vat import goods service foreign supplier part purchase price customer pay vat directly tax authority
rate vat applicable vat rule customer country supplier
vat return import vat treat vat output
effect import firm must charge vat lead procedure commonly know reverse charge
thus two reason firm might owe vat government
firm make taxable sale country customer collect vat sale customer
must pay vat government
firm make purchase foreign supplier
supplier charge vat
vat still due purchase must pay directly purchaser purchaser government
import vat relate input use firm make taxable supply import vat may reclaim next vat return
case net payment vat treat input vat and output vat
however firm make exempt partially exempt supply may able reclaim import vat full
assume black ltd expand operation include provision loan finance assume vat exempt goods import noir pty ltd attributable new uniform financial service staff
financial service broadly exempt vat
thus input vat attributable clothes purchase financial service staff will creditable
whilst output vat due full pay foreign supplier clothes financial service staff creditable input tax attributable exempt supply
whether business buy uniform uk supplier foreign supplier will still pay vat will recoverable
one effect reverse charge mechanism import goods service business make wholly exempt supply may nevertheless find output vat account import exceed turnover threshold vat registration
circumstance business may register vat despite make taxable supply customer
sometimes avoid importing via agent will account output import vat vat return
shortcut measure importer end consumer goods include arrange vat import account ultimate customer provide vat register
uk import vat sale registered customer collect behalf hmrc uk delivery company time delivery
thus account system regular importer collection vat customer delivery company avoid hold up vast quantity goods port entry import vat pay
two circumstance treatment import goods person might differ
first country operate low vat import duty
rule country would set monetary limit import vat duty need pay
foreign supplier would need indicate parcel value contents
second country insist foreign supplier large customer base must register vat customer country charge customer country vat
know would commonly apply foreign firm sell consumer goods service via internet via print catalogue customer
monetary limit sale value would set time limit apply annual aggregate value sale make country concerned
many eu member states operate limit set

various relief vat register business charge vat import tax import

two set rule within eu one transaction involve party outside eu another transaction party locate eu different member states

goods transport customer different member state the customer responsible account vat reverse charge procedure
thus destination principle use
exception customer present supplier country make purchase whilst eg foreign hotel bill
special rule apply goods subject installation or assembly operation
supplier must charge vat rate supplier country
word limited class transaction origin principle use
main exception rule customer visit supplier country personally make purchase transport goods back home personally eg french person go shopping trip dublin
special rule particular means transport eg car plane boat
note early destination system need rule determine place supply goods service
need identify country right tax particular supply
eu supply goods deliver customer deem take place place goods locate transport begin
frequently happen business register vat one eu country nevertheless find make supply excess vat registration threshold another country
instance complex supply chain scenario invoicing chain may mirror physical journey goods result firm deem supply goods member state home state
lead requirement register vat country lead two vat return two separate set vat rule understand
aspect present regime severe hindrance operation eu single market inhibit trade within eu particularly small medium sized business
specifically multiple country registration arise
delivery goods supplier one country end customer another invoicing chain involve intermediary third country
intermediary deem make supply country goods first allocate customer usually customer country
firm make sale customer another country sale catch distance selling rule
limit value goods sell rule another eu country must set either local equivalent instance uk limit
rather collect vat individual customer uk government require overseas supplier register vat uk supply customer uk exceed per annum
way hmrc need deal one company rather potentially thousand individual
eu attempt put patch first problem allow customer account vat goods effectively operate reverse charge procedure
idea behind first imperfect solution cover complex supply chain
directive eec
vat supply services destination system much hard identify tax import service identify tax import goods
service stop port vat pay

customer location use proxy place business use
customer multiple establishment branch different country country taxation country establishment use service intangible locate
similar eu fix
problem establishment pay service might establishment actually use service eg head office company country buy service foreign supplier country service use establishment purchase company countries charge vat circumstance
help answer question oecd identify approach problem current use around world

direct use approach find establishment actually use service intangible
approach use obvious country involve country use occur
direct delivery approach establishment service intangible deliver
approach use case service deliver face face training catering place use obviously place delivery
recharge method find establishment actually use service intangible question look company internal recharge arrangement
method useful say head office pay service intangible benefit part company recharge company foreign establishment accordance use
approach acknowledge common many service centrally purchase matter business efficiency achieve economy scale
oecd also recognize case might possible apportion cost service around different part company accord actual usage
service legal service benefit company whole cost allocation apportionment method involve estimation use
however allocation key fair reasonable
oecd envisage case customer location might good proxy place business use
different proxy approve main rule customer location lead inappropriate result
instance location immovable property could use determine country charge vat service relate property
global purchasing agreement service intangible within multinational group company
oecd present number example global purchasing structure analysis vat consequence
one give
company group centralized purchase company purchase company global auditing service cover group company resident countries
however company legal operational reason unable supply require service directly
therefore subcontract country work subsidiary resident country company also country work subsidiary resident country
six business agreement ie contract consider example
centralized purchasing agreement place taxation will country location company customer
supply auditing service country place taxation will country location company customer
supply auditing service in country sthe place taxation will country location company customer
recharge part price centralized purchasing agreement taxation will country domestic supply
recharge part price centralized purchasing agreement taxation will country company customer transaction locate
recharge part price centralized purchasing agreement place taxation will country company customer transaction locate
vat due centralized purchasing agreement thus accrue country
this may seem puzzling service supply actually provide well country
oecd justify treatment grounds service will eventually subject vat country provide eg vat audit country will accrue government country via contract
double taxation although might appear two layer vat present must remember company will able claim vat charge company central purchasing agreement input vat attributable supply
similarly company will claim vat purchase case payable reverse charge procedure country input tax attributable supply broadly draft guideline echo system place within eu since supplier eu customer see next section
guideline attempt identify workable proxy place consumption ensure vat due end up country consumption
differ accord type service provide

mechanic collect vat supplier supply service resident registered customer recommend oecd similar use eu case supplier discuss next section
supplier require register vat customer country
however compliance problematic
country enforce law against
oecd recommend country make easy possible supplier register vat order encourage voluntary compliance
full registration vat compliance procedure need cut down supplier keep administrative cost compliance minimum
even though less vat might collect way supplier could successfully subject full vat rule actually result vat nonresident supplier will refuse register
simplification might include check supplier part registration process importantly refund vat input supplier
payment electronic
invoice requirement vat purpose could waive
everything online else use vat agent deal vat compliance permit
although lack legal jurisdiction supplier might seem insurmountable problem oecd expect increase level information exchange assistance collection tax country facilitate oecd common reporting standard tax information see chapter will solve
word oecd hope country will help collect vat service
company resident country supply service customer country company register country vat
hope country legal jurisdiction company will step help country way eg collect vat company pass it on country
major practical problem many country great difficulty collect tax resident simply ability resource collect tax behalf government
even country sign up mutual assistance convention enthusiastic exchange information mutual assistance country collection tax mean resource collect vat revenue country
country right tax particular service
two proxy place consumption service consider far
place performance service
usual residence country customer
oecd recognize service will instance neither two proxy give right answer
word service might consume somewhere country customer usually resident
instance customer might consume service whilst foreign holiday
restaurant meal sporting event spot proxy use
type service consume country residence might involve supplier present access tv channel foreign hotel room download newspaper onto tablet whilst travel abroad

miss usually resident australia holiday indonesia whilst download book amazon onto electronic reading device read swimming pool country entitle collect vat purchase amazon would indonesia
police requirement though would even difficult police collection vat rule use normal residence customer
special rule would also apply service connection immovable property
mr mrs holiday flat morocco spanish company engage carry out regular maintenance irrespective mr mrs normally resident time maintenance carry out country entitle collect vat would morocco
oecd eu always treat service differently vat purpose depend vat status customer

version commit trader sell goods home country charge customer may wholly innocent vat fail pay tax authority
fraud come light trader perhaps somewhat chain goods
trader will pay input vat will charge output vat sale export
thus trader claim refund input vat rather merely offset input vat against output vat
tax authority thus ask make large refund vat match large receipt vat goods first sell on fraudulent trader
true mtic fraud occur importing export trader conspirator
possible goods might country sell yet another trader unsuspecting otherwise time
case fraud might refer carousel fraud goods keep on go around
typically goods involve high value low bulk technology item mobile phone handset computer chip
importantly thrive grey market goods lead time new product tend long time product despatch manufacturer may already overtake new technology
hence purchaser find way dispose
typically consignment goods change hand without write contract usually telephone without sight goods consignment might change hand several time day recently carbon trading permit target fraudster result exempt vat seem satisfactory way protect against fraud

inside country consignment split up disguise origin fraudulently export country hold out originate country rather dubai
sole reason involve dubai arrangement disguise true nature transaction
choice dubai extent switzerland may reflect attitude authority country towards regulation import
first approach adopt hmrc several country try deny input tax credit trader export goods claim input tax refund
unfortunately many case exporter innocent party case bond house cjeu rule exporter must means know goods export subject missing trader fraud claim refund input tax could deny

without valid vat registration would treat nonregistered customer would pay vat point entry uk goods show charge vat foreign supplier
neither two strategy without risk
first strategy run risk fraudster will merely turn attention goods blacklist goods evidence mtic fraud involve diamond soft drink confectionery
also de minimis limit per invoice rule apply allow fraudster fragment large contract many small one limit
unsurprisingly reverse charge procedure accompany considerable increase vat administration trader concern
tighten issue vat registration lead considerable hardship genuine business legally permit trade without registration registration threshold
extended checking procedure result long delay issue vat registration
eu consider extension reverse charge procedure purchase import would represent considerable alteration basic system vat
interestingly finally force return difficult subject adoption origin system trader must charge vat goods sell customer anywhere eu see europeancommission

addition geographical location country obviously important
long less well manned border scope smuggling
also country less develop neighbour may willing stream carrier bring goods
eu issue one avoid excise duty
vat customs duty make much difference movement goods excise duty still levy separately state subject minimum requirement require state levy overall weighted average retail selling price cigarette
prevalence uk citizen shop tobacco france think decrease significantly since rate excise duty increase france
problem means confine eu accord world bank approximately internationally trade cigarette per year eventually sell illegally
world health organization estimate base discrepancy report export report import cigarette cigarette smuggle year
main attraction smuggling much pay low excise tax one country rather high tax another avoid tax altogether
large scale container fraud think account around smuggle cigarette
difficult problem smuggling occur manufacturer complicit process major tobacco producer might sell infeasible quantity cigarette small nation certain knowledge cigarette will smuggle back manufacturer country
increase tobacco company profit increase sale

vat compliance cost burden create trade think dissuade many sme international expansion
increase compliance cost burden estimate per cent compare vat compliance cost trade domestic market
entirely inconsistent ethos eu single market
important issue sme generate per cent value add within eu outside financial sector therefore crucial health eu economy
ongoing high level miss trader carousel fraud
study produce aim improve working destination system within context eu single market
option would effectively limit mitc fraud vat vat pay eu supplier vat charge fraudulently country customer
supplier would charge vat even though customer establish different member state
either option might thus reduce revenue lose mitc fraud around
could exception customer good vat compliance record could continue buy goods crossborder within eu without pay vat supplier instead continue use reverse charge procedure
could know certified taxable person
exception might make case supply two company corporate group
case full list purchase supplier would keep certified customer
option could implement member states adopt standardized list product eligible reduce rate vat avoid damaging competition alternatively application standard rate vat
whilst would difference standard rate vat would create shopping around behaviour way country apply reduce rate vat certain goods country charge standard rate goods
implement either option could extend supplier goods via registration similar already use supply
report also propose measure would reduce compliance cost improve working eu vat system generally
option consider
limited improvement current rule eg require customer sign document declare receipt goods member state delivery
option would reduce mtic fraud significantly
reverse charge follow flow goods would effect mtic fraud
alignment vat place supply service proposal would harmonize place supply rule service goods
eu report the future vat
report entitle towards simple robust efficient vat system tailor single market report take account response public consultation carry out follow publication eu green paper see
generate many response flavour change need
principal problem identify fragmentation eu vat system national vat system make difficult sme take advantage eu single market due additional vat compliance cost trading outside home country
fact case report easy trade customer supplier customer supplier within eu

recommendation monthly vat return quarterly return small business annual turnover
would option make return paper although would make electronically
pwc estimate average cost firm submit vat return current system
proposal merely harmonization vat return deadline associated procedure rather harmonization underlie vat rule rate use member states
review rate structure vat view simplification especially reduce number different vat rate within country
address problem cause vat exemption public sector health social security etc term distortion competition complexity
problem acute high degree private sector involvement exempt class transaction
develop quick reaction mechanism deal sudden fraud miss trader fraud become endemic energy trading market

european commission publish green paper the future vat eu stimulate public debate the future eu vat system

current vat rule administrative requirement extremely burdensome business particularly small business
firm think discourage set up eu due administrative burden represent vat
business treat transaction domestic customer customer eu member states differently
world change since vat introduce term technology available run police system term type business undertake
instance financial service sector many time important adequately cater vat term
fact service generally account per cent total economic activity within eu eu vat system design primarily deal trade goods
vat become far important source government revenue since introduction
population age pensioner form high proportion population income tax effective revenue raise tool
pensioner may earn still spend
also vat stable source government revenue level revenue directly dependent economic health country extent say corporation tax
original aim common system vat achieve
despite requirement member states vat system conform vat directive vat system operate member states tend different business wish operate cross border eu need knowledge several vat system
discourage firm expand europe
green paper note vat revenue represent per cent vat could collect vat charge standard rate everything
many item either exempt vat tax reduce rate
country much good respect
eu vat system leaky vat gap ie difference amount vat collect current rule ought collect around per cent average eu member states high per cent
much vat gap attribute miss trader fraud even amount vat uncollect due cause consider unacceptable
deal trade within eu green paper proposal two important proposal consider
however reality mtic fraud ineffectiveness short term informational measure limited extension reverse charge combat mean adopt origin system time the future rule out
whilst radical proposal contain green paper develop present see discussion report detail proposal take forward eu nevertheless interest
green paper controversially suggest reverse charge mechanism could apply transaction domestic cross border
whilst would put end miss trader fraud would radically alter vat
key feature vat pay supplier part purchase transaction would lose vat would arguably change indirect tax direct tax consumption
general reverse charge every vat register business would pay vat purchase supplier government
vat would longer concept fractionate payment
supplier would longer charge vat registered trader customer
would present government practice little vat would pay over government sale customer
vat due pay government purchase make output tax cancel out claim input tax deduction identical amount purchase attributable taxable supply
table compare current system propose system
example assume trader fully taxable make vat return quarterly basis vat due payable one month after the end of the quarter
although case total amount vat pay government result change general reverse charge system government wait receive vat revenue

alternative proposal supplier charge vat customer different member state rate vat accord vat system customer country
however would inordinately burdensome supplier unless vat charge could pay supplier tax authority rather particular customer member state
would presuppose kind clear house pitfall complication entail
appear carry forward option propose ey study discuss

global fdi fall forecast remain relatively static recovery take long expect

importantly fdi increase economy structurally weak inflow least develop country hit record high

also important avenue develop country build productive capacity include technology dissemination skill building thus open up opportunity long term industrial upgrading

incentive design attract fdi typically manufacture assembly service centre centre take variety form include
low tax rate foreign investor

unctad report define tax incentive incentive reduce tax burden enterprise order induce invest particular project sector

offer guidance design governance reform tax incentive
reduce corporate tax holiday widely use form tax incentive attract fdi
reduction standard rate corporation tax may offer order attract fdi certain industry sector geographical region
tax holiday use similarly provide exemption payment corporate income tax specified period often five year
form tax incentive generally consider blunt instrument difficult constrain application specific target recipient advantage relative simplicity relatively low compliance burden recipient enterprise
malaysia example use two main form tax incentive pioneer status tax holiday five to ten year investment tax allowance deductibility capital expenditure
requirement minimum level investment employment incentive apply particular activity attractive package incentive available technology knowledge base activity
addition corporate tax rate reduce per cent per cent per cent
india tax holiday it developer end amid concern would dent india attractiveness investment destination
developer enjoy tax holiday locate special economic zones will pay minimum alternate tax
number problem arise respect form tax incentive
case reduce corporate tax rate reduction need level well prevail global average order effective
addition benefit loss make enterprise
reduce rate apply specify activity sector may also result market distortion
remember make investment decision headline corporate tax rate decisive rather firm look effective rate calculate divide total tax taxable income differ significantly headline rate depend progressive band special reduction also may vary result different enterprise characteristic finance profile
tax holiday may also result market distortion aim specific industry argument attractive highly mobile footloose industry potentially avail holiday move on another jurisdiction holiday period expire
tax holiday therefore may limit potential attract long term investment
investment allowance credit target form tax incentive design encourage specific form investment
investment allowance deduction taxable income base percentage capital investment come two main form accelerate depreciation enhance deduction
accelerate depreciation entail provide fast write off tax purpose cost capital acquisition would normally available short period time indicate asset useful economic life
enhance deduction entail grant tax deduction amount excess expenditure actually incur example per cent qualify expenditure will treat deductible
former create timing advantage taxpayer overall cost government provide incentive normal depreciation provision provide
latter however entail loss potential revenue government
case value incentive firm will vary depend applicable corporate income tax rate
investment project involve high level capital expenditure early stage investment allowance may benefit provision excess deduction carry forward future period offset future tax liability
investment tax credit similar investment allowance allow fix percentage qualifying investment expenditure
may flat relevant percentage apply expenditure incur each year may incremental percentage apply expenditure excess define base example move average expenditure specify number precede year
country unused investment tax credit may refundable make scheme considerably attractive alternative carry forward expensive government
important difference attract short latter stability predictability tax system become important consideration invest firm
administrative capacity develop country vary considerably constrain cultural social well economic political condition
several administrative factor impact particularly effectiveness tax incentive system include transparency discretion follow up unctad
arguably transparent incentive system easy will investor understand
include clarity condition attach incentive example specify region qualify name rather form generic description less developed region
question discretion relate extent government official able use discretion make decision granting incentive
allow much discretion may pave way corruption hand certain degree discretion facilitate great flexibility tailor incentive need particular investor
follow firm benefit incentive also important ensure condition attach incentive condition fulfil completion within particular time frame
fdi project properly monitor become impossible ensure expect investment actually materialize
recent report oecd include follow example potential abuse tax incentive demonstrate political interference significantly reduce beneficial effect tax incentive ramification beyond loss tax revenue ghana appear relatively well administer quite clearly define law require parliamentary approval
however fact still strong evidence significant abuse indicate widespread abuse tax incentive develop world
glaring example registration major timber company tax free export processing zones epz
timber company grant epz status despite fact secure input conduct operation ie log within domestic economy
mean little need incentive resource timber fixed asset
result country receive fraction potential tax revenue log lead widespread deforestation
widely believe economically unjustifiable granting epz status drive political patronage
government pass law forbid log firm acquire epz status new law good news ghana also implicit acknowledgement scope early abuse
law forbid epz status plastic firm apparently response evidence illegally trade within domestic economy without pay appropriate tax
seebird discussion administrative capacity develop country
host government hope achieve
general level host government hope achieve increase national welfare increase degree economic integration economy country
however use tax incentive achieve goal expand foreign control productive asset rather available means increase trade goods international licensing technology encourage large flow portfolio capital hanson
host government typically anticipate will fdi
effect may include adoption domestic firm superior management and production technique bring in foreign mne increase demand local goods service bring increase wealth workforce employ mne possibility mne will source least raw material local supplier
host government may able share economic rent mne although grant tax holiday similar incentive advantage foregone
against must weigh loss host economy crowd out mne domestic firm
measure net gain fdi notoriously difficult
political kudos accrue successfully attract large mne build substantial production facility overlook
way home country recognize tax incentive offer host country will impact attractiveness incentive investor
home country use worldwide system tax foreign income subsequent credit foreign tax pay will effectively claw back benefit incentive extent home country tax rate exceed effective ie rate host country
reason tax spare provision include dtt first discuss chapter
suggest home country begin question efficacy tax sparing argue may offer windfall gain investor impact net additional investment
precise term tax spare provision depend preference particular country involve relative bargaining power
develop country will obviously try tax spare provision include treaty negotiation secure much credit possible
potential variation illustrate treaty negotiate thailand treaty israel czech republic provide mutual tax spare credit
treaty spain simply mention tax exempt reduce investment promotion act deem pay
treaty japan australia new zealand include minimum shareholding percentage qualify foreign tax credit dividend thai company
certain treaty provide deem pay rate switzerland luxembourg sweden high current thai withholding tax interest dividend royalty

recent study impact tax spare provision japanese outbound fdi confirm link conclude evidence suggest japanese fdi flow tax spare country almost three time big sparing country indicate broad level tax spare provision influence investor location choice
us normally enter tax spare arrangement
even country offer tax sparing often place time limit life arrangement typically ten year from the day treaty make
whilst provision sometimes make arrangement extend extension means always make
another potential source distortion context tax incentive use transfer pricing investor artificially inflate profit attributable host country concurrently deflate profit home jurisdiction
extent occur however extremely difficult detect let alone quantify
interestingly country use special tax incentive attract foreign investment pay much close attention transfer pricing
china example adopt intensive approach transfer pricing amid concern use shift profit china avoid chinese tax
china introduce system special tax adjustment tackle include transfer pricing
measure include requirement contemporaneous documentation narrow interpretation range acceptable arm length price
one interpretation change china seek signal ready join developed country term sophistication tax policy

## Requirement 

### Pytorch/Torch

Some of the code, like Stanza, need Torch, however, it is always sensible for
use to pre-download the torch, and torch-vision, for The auto-download by pip
will corrupt your virtual-env. So I recommend you download this package before
go to:
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

Remember, Torch will be auto-download when you use requirements.txt, 
so you should config the cuda and torch before download this package, or it will
be automatically run as CPU-version.

### Libre Office in windows

Libre office is a free software and could easily help you to read the doc, if you do not have one then some of code
could
not run properly.

kindly use the guidance below, I use this to config my cmd in windows, Unix-like/BSD sure be easier.

### stanza(Stanford core nlp)
Stanza always cause errors and do not be worry:
IF any resource error: try:
```stanza.download('en')``` or your language
This version do not show so much errors.
